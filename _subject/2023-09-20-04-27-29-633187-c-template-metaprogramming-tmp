Introduction to C++ template metaprogramming (TMP)
Basics of TMP: templates and type deduction
Type traits in TMP: std::is_same, std::is_pointer, etc.
Template specialization in TMP: partial specialization, full specialization
Using TMP to achieve compile-time computation
Recursion in TMP: recursive template functions, recursive template structs
TMP and conditional compilation: using std::conditional, #ifdef, etc.
Using TMP to implement compile-time data structures
TMP and static polymorphism: CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern)
TMP and constexpr: using constexpr functions in template metaprogramming
TMP and variadic templates: variadic template parameters, template parameter packs
TMP and type manipulation: type lists, type concatenation, type extraction
TMP and type deduction: decltype, std::declval, std::decay, etc.
TMP and type traits: extending type traits with custom implementations
TMP and expression templates: using TMP to optimize expressions at compile-time
TMP and SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)
TMP and non-type template parameters: integer, floating-point, and enum parameters
