In modern C++, the `auto` keyword allows automatic type deduction, making code more concise and readable. However, in certain scenarios, we may need to explicitly specify the type while still benefiting from type deduction. This is where `decltype` comes into play.

`decltype` is a powerful type inference operator that examines an expression and deduces its type. It can be used in conjunction with `auto` to combine the benefits of type deduction and explicit type specification.

Consider the following example:

```cpp
auto x = 42; // x is deduced as int

decltype(x) y; // y has the same type as x, i.e., int

y = 10;
```

In this example, `auto` is used to deduce the type of variable `x` as `int`. Then, `decltype(x)` is used to specify the type of `y` as the same type as `x`, which is `int`. This approach allows us to explicitly specify the type of `y` while still leveraging the benefits of type deduction.

Another use case for `decltype` is when dealing with function templates:

```cpp
template <typename T, typename U>
auto multiply(T a, U b) -> decltype(a * b) {
    return a * b;
}

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    double b = 2.5;

    auto result = multiply(a, b); // result is deduced as double

    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, the `multiply` function template uses `decltype` to deduce the return type based on the expression `a * b`. This enables the function to return the appropriate type based on the types of its parameters.

By combining `decltype` and `auto` in this way, we can benefit from the conciseness of type deduction while still maintaining control over the specific types used in our code.

To summarize, `decltype` is a valuable tool in C++ that allows us to explicitly specify types while leveraging type deduction. It is particularly useful when combined with the `auto` keyword, as it enables us to write concise and readable code without sacrificing control over types.
