When it comes to programming languages, C++ is known for its strong typing and static typing. However, it also offers some features that allow for type inference and runtime polymorphism, which can make code more flexible and maintainable.

## Type Inference

In C++, type inference refers to the ability of the compiler to deduce the type of a variable based on its initializer or usage context. This eliminates the need for the programmer to explicitly specify the type, making the code more concise and readable.

For example, instead of writing:

```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers;
```

You can simply write:

```cpp
auto numbers = std::vector<int>();
```

The `auto` keyword instructs the compiler to deduce the type of `numbers` based on the initializer (`std::vector<int>()` in this case). This can be particularly useful when dealing with complex data structures or with generic programming.

## Runtime Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. In C++, polymorphism is typically achieved through virtual functions and inheritance.

With runtime polymorphism, the specific implementation of a function is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object. This provides great flexibility, as it allows for dynamic dispatch and enables code to work with objects of different types without explicitly knowing the exact type at compile-time.

Here's an example to illustrate runtime polymorphism in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() {
        std::cout << "Drawing a shape." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        std::cout << "Drawing a circle." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        std::cout << "Drawing a rectangle." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shape1 = new Circle();
    Shape* shape2 = new Rectangle();
    
    shape1->draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle.
    shape2->draw(); // Output: Drawing a rectangle.
    
    delete shape1;
    delete shape2;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have a base class called `Shape` and two derived classes, `Circle` and `Rectangle`. By declaring the `draw()` function as `virtual` in the base class, we enable runtime polymorphism. We can then create objects of different derived classes and call the `draw()` function on them, which will be dynamically dispatched to the appropriate implementation according to the actual type of the object.

By leveraging type inference and runtime polymorphism, you can write more flexible and readable code in C++. These features allow for more efficient development and maintainability in complex projects.
