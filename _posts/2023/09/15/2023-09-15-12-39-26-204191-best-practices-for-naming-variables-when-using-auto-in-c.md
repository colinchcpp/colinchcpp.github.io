1. Be descriptive: Regardless of whether you're using `auto` or explicitly declaring a variable's type, it's crucial to choose descriptive and meaningful names. This helps improve the readability and maintainability of your code. Avoid single-letter variable names or generic names like `var` or `temp`. Instead, choose names that convey the purpose or meaning of the variable.

```cpp
auto numberOfStudents = 20; // Good

auto count = 20; // Not recommended
```

2. Match the variable type, not the initializer: Although `auto` deduces the type from the initializer, it's good practice to name the variable based on its intended type rather than the specific initializer value.

```cpp
auto averageGrade = calculateAverage(); // Good

auto result = calculateAverage(); // Not recommended
```

3. Consider prefix or postfix conventions: To provide additional information about the variable type or usage, you can use certain conventions like prefixes or postfixes. This can help to differentiate between different types of variables or signal their purpose.

```cpp
auto numStudents = 20; // Prefix convention

auto scoreSum = 0.0; // Postfix convention
```

4. Follow consistent naming conventions: Consistency is key when it comes to variable naming. Choose a naming convention that aligns with your project or team's style guide and stick to it throughout your codebase. This could be camel case, snake case, or any other convention as long as it's consistently applied.

```cpp
auto totalPrice = calculatePrice(); // Camel case

auto function_result = calculatePrice(); // Snake case
```

In conclusion, while using `auto` in C++ can make your code more concise and readable, it's crucial to follow these best practices for variable naming. Being descriptive, matching the actual type, considering conventions, and maintaining consistency will ultimately lead to more maintainable and understandable code.
