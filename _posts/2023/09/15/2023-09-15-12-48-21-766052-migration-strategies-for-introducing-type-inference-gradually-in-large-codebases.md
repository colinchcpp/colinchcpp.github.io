Migrating a large codebase to a new technology or language feature can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to introducing type inference. Type inference can greatly improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce the likelihood of runtime errors. However, applying type inference to a large codebase all at once can be risky and time-consuming. In this blog post, we will discuss some migration strategies that can help in gradually introducing type inference in your large codebases.


## Strategy 1: Identify Low-risk Areas

One approach to gradually introduce type inference is to identify low-risk areas within your codebase. These are areas where making changes won't have a significant impact on the overall functionality of your application. Start by identifying smaller modules or components that are relatively isolated from the rest of the codebase.

Once you have identified these low-risk areas, you can begin by introducing type inference in these specific modules. By doing this, you can observe the impact of type inference on a smaller scale before gradually expanding its usage to other parts of the codebase.


## Strategy 2: Use Flags or Feature Toggles

Another effective strategy is to use feature flags or toggles to enable or disable type inference in specific sections of your codebase. By introducing a configuration option, you can gradually turn on type inference for specific modules or files.

Using feature flags allows you to control the rollout of type inference in a more controlled manner. You can start by enabling type inference for a small percentage of users or in specific environments such as staging or testing. This allows for gradual monitoring and gathering of feedback to ensure a smooth transition to type inference.


## Strategy 3: Pilot Projects

Consider taking the pilot project approach to migrate to type inference gradually. Select a smaller, well-contained project or module within your codebase that can serve as a testbed for type inference adoption.

By choosing a pilot project, you can focus specifically on migrating to type inference without the complexity of the entire codebase. This approach not only provides an opportunity for experimentation but also helps in identifying any potential challenges that may arise during the migration process.


## Strategy 4: Automated Tooling

Leveraging automated tools can help speed up the migration process and ensure consistency when introducing type inference in a large codebase. There are tools available that can assist in automatically inferring types in your code, thereby reducing the manual effort required.

Automated tools can analyze your codebase, identify variables and function signatures, and suggest appropriate type inferences. While these tools may not provide a 100% accurate result, they can certainly help in scaling up the migration process.


## Strategy 5: Documentation and Training

Introducing type inference in a large codebase also requires proper documentation and training for the development team. Having comprehensive documentation that explains the benefits, best practices, and potential challenges of type inference is crucial.

Additionally, providing training sessions or workshops to familiarize the team with type inference concepts can help them adopt and leverage this feature effectively. Encouraging discussions and knowledge sharing within the team can also foster a smooth transition.


### Conclusion

Migrating a large codebase to introduce type inference gradually can be a challenging task. To minimize risks and ensure a successful migration, it is essential to adopt careful planning and gradually implement type inference in lower-risk areas.

By following strategies such as identifying low-risk areas, using flags or toggles, pilot projects, automated tooling, and documentation/training, you can effectively introduce type inference and leverage its benefits in your large codebase, resulting in more maintainable and robust code.
