C++ is a powerful programming language that has evolved over the years with the release of different language standards. One area that has seen significant changes is type inference, which refers to the ability of the compiler to deduce the type of a variable based on its usage.

In this blog post, we will explore some of the key changes in type inference rules across different C++ language standards, from C++98 to the latest C++20.

## C++98

In C++98, type inference was limited, and explicit type declarations were required in most cases. Variables needed to be explicitly declared with their types, like `int x = 10;` or `std::string name = "John";`. 

## C++11

With the release of C++11, type inference saw significant improvements with the introduction of the `auto` keyword. The `auto` keyword allows the compiler to deduce the type of a variable based on its initializer. For example:

```cpp
auto x = 10; // Deduces `int` type for x
auto name = "John"; // Deduces `const char*` type for name
```

C++11 also introduced the `decltype` specifier, which allows the compiler to deduce the type of an expression. This can be useful when dealing with complex return types or template types.

## C++14

C++14 further enhanced type inference with the `decltype(auto)` specifier. This specifier combines the features of `auto` and `decltype`, allowing the compiler to deduce the type of an expression while preserving the reference and const qualifiers. For example:

```cpp
const int& func();
decltype(auto) result = func(); // Deduces `const int&` type for result
```

## C++17

C++17 introduced the `auto` template parameter, which allows function templates to have deduced return types. This reduces the need for explicit type declarations in function templates. For example:

```cpp
template <auto N>
void printNumber() {
    std::cout << N << std::endl;
}

printNumber<10>(); // Deduces `int` type for N
```

C++17 also introduced the `[[nodiscard]]` attribute, which allows the programmer to specify that the return value of a function should not be ignored.

## C++20

C++20 brings further refinements to type inference with the introduction of the `concept` keyword. Concepts allow the programmer to define requirements for template arguments, enabling more precise type deduction. Concepts make generic programming in C++ more expressive and easier to work with.

## Conclusion

Type inference in C++ has come a long way since the early days of the language. From the limited capabilities of C++98 to the powerful type deduction mechanisms of C++20, each new language standard has brought significant improvements. Understanding these changes can help developers write more concise and expressive code.

With C++ continuing to evolve, it will be interesting to see what future language standards bring in terms of type inference and other language features.
