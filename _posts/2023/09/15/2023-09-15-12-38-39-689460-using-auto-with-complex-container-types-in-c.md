In C++, the `auto` keyword is a powerful tool that allows us to automatically deduce the type of a variable at compile-time. While `auto` is commonly used with simple types like integers and strings, it can also be used with complex container types, such as vectors and maps.

By using `auto` with complex container types, we can simplify our code, make it more readable, and avoid repetitive type declarations. Here's how we can use `auto` with different container types in C++:

## Vector

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Using `auto` with std::vector
    for (auto num : numbers) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we have a vector of integers named `numbers`. By using `auto` in the range-based for loop, the compiler automatically deduces the type of each element in the vector (`int` in this case). This makes the code more concise, especially when dealing with complex container types.

## Map

```cpp
{% raw %}
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::map<int, std::string> studentGrades = {{1, "A"}, {2, "B"}, {3, "C"}};

    // Using `auto` with std::map
    for (const auto& pair : studentGrades) {
        std::cout << "Student ID: " << pair.first << ", Grade: " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
{% endraw %}
```

In the above code, we have a map containing student IDs as keys and their corresponding grades as values. By using `auto` with the range-based for loop, the compiler automatically deduces the type of each element in the map (`std::pair<const int, std::string>` in this case). This allows us to access the key-value pairs without explicitly specifying the types.

Using `auto` with complex container types not only simplifies our code but also makes it more resistant to future changes. If we decide to change the container type, we don't need to update the type declaration throughout the code. Instead, the compiler will automatically deduce the correct type based on the container used.

In conclusion, using `auto` with complex container types in C++ can greatly improve code readability and reduce redundancy. It is a powerful feature that allows the compiler to automatically deduce the type, making our code more concise and easier to maintain.
