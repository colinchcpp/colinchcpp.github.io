Since its introduction in C++20, the C++ Modules feature has been a highly anticipated addition to the language. Modules provide a more efficient and organized way of managing code dependencies, leading to faster compilation times and improved code readability. In this blog post, we will explore the support for C++ Modules in some of the popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

## Visual Studio
Visual Studio has been at the forefront of C++ development, and it embraces C++ Modules with full support. With the release of Visual Studio 2019 version 16.10, Microsoft introduced complete C++ Modules support. This includes support for module definition files (`.ixx`), module partitions, and module interfaces. Visual Studio's IntelliSense provides accurate code completion and information for module imports, making it easier to work with C++ Modules.

## CLion
CLion, a popular cross-platform IDE from JetBrains, has also implemented support for C++ Modules. Users can leverage the power of C++ Modules using the CMake build system. CLion detects modules in the project and provides proper code highlighting, completion, and navigation for module imports. The IDE also supports module partitioning and module interfaces, allowing for efficient code organization.

## Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code, a lightweight yet powerful IDE, has gained tremendous popularity in the development community. While the support for C++ Modules in Visual Studio Code is not as extensive as in Visual Studio or CLion, several extensions are available to enhance the experience. The C/C++ extension, for example, provides basic support for C++ Modules, including code highlighting and navigation for module imports.

## Xcode
Apple's Xcode, the IDE for macOS and iOS development, is gradually expanding its support for C++ Modules. The latest versions of Xcode (starting from Xcode 13) have improved support for C++ Modules. Xcode can correctly parse module interfaces, allowing for accurate code highlighting and completion. However, it's worth noting that support in Xcode is still evolving and might not be as feature-rich as in other IDEs.

## Conclusion

C++ Modules bring significant improvements to the C++ language, and IDEs are quickly adopting support for this exciting feature. Visual Studio, CLion, Visual Studio Code, and Xcode are continuously improving their support for C++ Modules, enabling developers to leverage the benefits of faster compilation times and better code organization. As C++ Modules become more widely adopted, we can expect further enhancements in IDEs to make working with modules even more seamless.
