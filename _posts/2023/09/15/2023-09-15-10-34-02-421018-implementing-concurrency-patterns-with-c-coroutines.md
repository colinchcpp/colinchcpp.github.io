Concurrency is an important aspect of modern programming, especially in applications that require multitasking and parallelism. Traditionally, concurrency in C++ has been achieved using threads and locks. However, the new C++20 standard introduced a powerful feature called coroutines, which provides a more efficient and structured way to handle concurrent programming.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement common concurrency patterns using coroutines in C++.

## 1. Producer-Consumer Pattern

The Producer-Consumer pattern involves one or more producers that generate data and one or more consumers that consume that data. With coroutines, we can easily implement this pattern using async generators.

```cpp
Generator<std::string> producer() {
    co_yield "Data 1";
    co_yield "Data 2";
    co_yield "Data 3";
}

void consumer() {
    auto gen = producer();
    for (auto data : gen) {
        // Process the data
        std::cout << data << std::endl;
    }
}
```

In the above example, `producer` is an async generator that yields data items. The `consumer` function retrieves the data items one by one from the generator and processes them.

## 2. Parallel Execution Pattern

The Parallel Execution pattern involves executing tasks in parallel and waiting for all tasks to complete. With coroutines, we can use `co_await` to suspend execution until a task completes.

```cpp
Task<int> longRunningTask() {
    // Simulate some time-consuming task
    co_await std::chrono::seconds(5);
    co_return 42;
}

Task<int> parallelExecution() {
    std::vector<Task<int>> tasks;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        tasks.push_back(longRunningTask());
    }

    int result = 0;
    for (auto& task : tasks) {
        result += co_await task;
    }

    co_return result;
}
```

In the above example, `longRunningTask` simulates a time-consuming task that executes for 5 seconds. The `parallelExecution` function creates multiple instances of this task and waits for all of them to complete. The total result is then calculated by summing the returned values.

## Conclusion

C++ coroutines provide a powerful and structured way to handle concurrent programming. By leveraging coroutines, we can easily implement common concurrency patterns such as the Producer-Consumer pattern and Parallel Execution pattern. This helps improve the efficiency and maintainability of our code.
