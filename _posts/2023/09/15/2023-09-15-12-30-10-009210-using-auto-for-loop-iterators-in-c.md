Traditionally, when writing a loop, we would have to explicitly specify the type of the iterator:

```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (std::vector<int>::iterator it = numbers.begin(); it != numbers.end(); ++it) {
    // Use *it to access the value, e.g. std::cout << *it << std::endl;
}
```

With the `auto` keyword, we can simplify the code by letting the compiler figure out the correct type:

```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (auto it = numbers.begin(); it != numbers.end(); ++it) {
    // Use *it to access the value, e.g. std::cout << *it << std::endl;
}
```

The `auto` keyword uses type inference to determine the type of the iterator based on the type of the collection being iterated. This not only saves us from having to write long and sometimes complex type names, but it also ensures that we use the correct type without any possibility of making mistakes.

Using `auto` for loop iterators is particularly useful when dealing with iterators of complex and nested containers, where the type names can become very long and cumbersome to type and read.

By adopting the `auto` keyword for loop iterators, we can write cleaner and more concise code, reducing the chances of introducing bugs due to incorrect type specifications. It also makes the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.
