When working with the `auto` keyword in C++, it can bring convenience by automatically deducing the type of a variable at compile-time. However, there can be cases where type inference becomes ambiguous, leading to compilation errors. In this article, we will explore some scenarios where type inference ambiguities can occur with `auto` and learn how to resolve them effectively.

## Scenario 1: Ambiguous Initialization

Consider the following code snippet:

```cpp
auto number = 10;
```

In this case, the type of `number` is deduced as `int` because we initialize it with an integer literal. However, what if we initialize the variable with an expression that can be multiple types, such as a ternary operator?

```cpp
auto number = condition ? 10 : 5.5;
```

Here, the `auto` keyword will cause type deduction to become ambiguous because the expression `condition ? 10 : 5.5` can be either an `int` or a `double`. To resolve this ambiguity, we need to provide a clear type hint to the compiler using static casting:

```cpp
auto number = static_cast<double>(condition ? 10 : 5.5);
```

By explicitly specifying the type as `double`, we ensure that the compiler understands our intended type.

## Scenario 2: Ambiguity between Reference and Value Type

In some cases, the use of `auto` with references can also lead to type inference ambiguities. Consider the following code:

```cpp
int x = 10;
auto& ref = (condition) ? x : x;
```

Here, we attempt to initialize a reference `ref` using the ternary operator, where both sides are references to `x`. However, this usage will result in a compilation error due to ambiguity. 

One possible solution is to declare `ref` as a `const` reference:

```cpp
const auto& ref = (condition) ? x : x;
```

By adding the `const` qualifier, we resolve the ambiguity by ensuring that the type of `ref` is a constant reference to `x`.

## Conclusion

While `auto` brings convenience by automatically deducing types, it can also lead to type inference ambiguities in certain situations. By understanding these scenarios and applying appropriate type hints or qualifiers, we can effectively resolve these ambiguities and ensure successful compilation.
