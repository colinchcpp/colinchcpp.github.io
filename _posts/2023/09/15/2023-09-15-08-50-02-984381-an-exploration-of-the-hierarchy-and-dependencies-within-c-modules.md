C++20 introduced a new feature called *Modules* that aims to improve the build times and overall performance of C++ codebases. Modules provide a mechanism for separating interface and implementation, allowing for faster compilation and more efficient dependency management.

In this blog post, we will explore the hierarchy and dependencies within C++ Modules to gain a better understanding of how they work and how they can be leveraged to optimize our codebase.

## What are C++ Modules?

C++ Modules are a new way of organizing and managing code in C++. They allow us to divide our code into logical units called *modules*, which can be compiled independently and then combined to form the final executable.

Traditionally, C++ code uses header files to declare classes, functions, and other entities. These header files are then included in various source files, leading to repetitive and sometimes redundant code parsing.

Modules, on the other hand, eliminate the need for separate header files by providing a way to directly export and import declarations. This eliminates the need for preprocessor-based include guards and allows for better separation of interface and implementation.

## Module Hierarchy

In C++ Modules, we have a hierarchy of modules, similar to a folder structure. Each module has its own set of declarations and dependencies. The hierarchy begins with the *global module*, which contains the top-level declarations available throughout the program.

Below the global module, we have sub-modules, each with their own set of declarations. Sub-modules can depend on other sub-modules and can also export their declarations to be used by other modules.

The hierarchy allows for better organization and encapsulation of code. Each module can determine what it wants to export and what it wants to keep private. This improves the modularity of the codebase and enhances code reuse.

## Dependency Management

One of the key benefits of C++ Modules is efficient dependency management. Modules specify their dependencies using the `import` directive. By explicitly declaring dependencies, we can build a clear picture of how modules rely on each other.

When a module depends on another module, it imports the necessary declarations using the `import` directive. This creates a direct link between the two modules and ensures that any changes made to the imported module are reflected in the importing module.

Managing dependencies in this way eliminates the need for unnecessary recompilation of code that hasn't changed. Only the modules with modified declarations or dependencies need to be recompiled, leading to faster build times and improved overall performance.

## Conclusion

C++ Modules provide a modern and efficient way of organizing and managing code in C++. The hierarchical structure and explicit dependency management capabilities allow for better separation of concerns and improved code reuse.

By leveraging C++ Modules, developers can experience faster build times, reduced code redundancy, and enhanced overall performance. With its focus on interface and implementation separation, C++ Modules pave the way for more scalable and maintainable codebases.

So dive into C++ Modules and embrace the power of efficient hierarchy and dependency management in your projects!
