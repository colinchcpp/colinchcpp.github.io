One of the key features of C++ is its ability to provide strong type safety. Type safety ensures that variables are used in a consistent and appropriate manner, reducing the chances of logical errors and improving the overall reliability of the code. In this blog post, we will explore how constructors can be used to enforce type safety in C++.

## What is a constructor?

In C++, a constructor is a special member function that is used to initialize objects of a class. It is called automatically when an object is created, ensuring that the object is properly initialized before it is used. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

## Ensuring type safety with constructors

Constructors can be designed to accept only specific types of arguments, thus ensuring type safety in the class. Here is an example:

```cpp
class Rectangle {
private:
    int width;
    int height;
public:
    Rectangle(int w, int h) : width(w), height(h) {}
};

int main() {
    Rectangle rect(5, "abc"); // This will generate a compilation error
    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, the constructor of the `Rectangle` class accepts two integers, representing the width and height of the rectangle. If we attempt to create a `Rectangle` object with a string argument, such as `Rectangle rect(5, "abc")`, the code will fail to compile, thanks to the type safety enforced by the constructor.

## Using explicit keyword

In some cases, it is desirable to disallow implicit conversions when creating objects using constructors. The `explicit` keyword can be used to achieve this. Let's consider the following example:

```cpp
class Celsius {
private:
    double temperature;
public:
    explicit Celsius(double temp) : temperature(temp) {}
};

void displayTemperature(Celsius celsius) {
    std::cout << "Temperature: " << celsius.getTemp() << " degrees Celsius" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    Celsius c = 25.5; // Implicit conversion is disallowed
    displayTemperature(30.2); // Implicit conversion is disallowed
    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, the constructor of the `Celsius` class is marked as `explicit`. Adding the `explicit` keyword prevents the compiler from performing implicit conversions. Therefore, the statements `Celsius c = 25.5` and `displayTemperature(30.2)` will generate compilation errors, since they rely on implicit conversions.

## Conclusion

Constructors play a crucial role in enforcing type safety in C++. By designing constructors to accept only specific types of arguments and using the `explicit` keyword when necessary, we can ensure that objects are initialized with the correct types, reducing the likelihood of logical errors. This enhances the robustness and reliability of our C++ code.
