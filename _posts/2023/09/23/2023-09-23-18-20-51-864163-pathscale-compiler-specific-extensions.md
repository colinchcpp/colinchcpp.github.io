1. ```#pragma pathscale```

The ```#pragma pathscale``` directive is used to enable or disable specific compiler optimizations. This directive provides fine-grained control over various code transformations and optimizations performed by the PathScale Compiler.

For example, you can use the ```#pragma pathscale off``` directive to disable all compiler optimizations temporarily. This can be useful when debugging your code or when you want to compare the performance of optimized and unoptimized versions of your program.

2. ```__attribute__((pathscale_vector))```

The ```__attribute__((pathscale_vector))``` attribute instructs the PathScale Compiler to generate vectorized instructions for a specific loop or function. Vectorization is a technique that allows concurrent execution of multiple operations on multiple data elements, leading to significant performance improvements.

To enable vectorization for a loop, you can annotate it with the ```__attribute__((pathscale_vector))``` attribute. For example:

```C++
#pragma pathscale_vector
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
   // Loop logic
}
```

This attribute helps the compiler identify loops that can benefit from vectorization and generate optimized code accordingly.

Using these PathScale Compiler-specific extensions, you can fine-tune your code and take full advantage of the compiler's capabilities. Remember to always profile and benchmark your code to ensure that these optimizations are indeed improving performance.
