In C++, the Singleton pattern is used to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is achieved by making the constructor of the class private and providing a static method to get the instance.

Here is an example of constructors used in implementing the Singleton pattern in C++:

## Classic Singleton Pattern

```cpp
class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;
    Singleton() {} // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    
public:
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (instance == nullptr) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }

        return instance;
    }
};
```

In this example, `Singleton` is a class with a private default constructor. The `getInstance` method is responsible for creating and returning the instance of the `Singleton` class. If no instance exists, it creates a new one; otherwise, it returns the existing instance.

## Thread-Safe Singleton Pattern

```cpp
#include <mutex>

class ThreadSafeSingleton {
private:
    static ThreadSafeSingleton* instance;
    static std::mutex mutex;
    
    ThreadSafeSingleton() {} // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    
public:
    static ThreadSafeSingleton* getInstance() {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        
        if (instance == nullptr) {
            instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
        }

        return instance;
    }
};
```

In the thread-safe version of the Singleton pattern, we introduce a `std::mutex` to ensure that only one thread can create an instance at a time. This prevents multiple threads from creating different instances simultaneously.

The `getInstance` method now uses a `std::lock_guard` to acquire the lock on the `mutex` before checking if an instance already exists. If no instance exists, it creates a new one within the locked section.

## Conclusion

Constructors are vital in implementing the Singleton pattern in C++. By making the constructor private, we ensure that the class cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, we provide a static method to retrieve the single instance of the class.

Using different strategies for instance creation, such as the classic Singleton pattern or the thread-safe Singleton pattern, we can control how the singleton object is created and accessed. However, care must be taken while implementing singletons to ensure thread safety and prevent misuse.
