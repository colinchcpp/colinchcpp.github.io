The NAG Fortran Compiler is widely used for scientific and engineering applications, offering robust features and performance optimizations. However, it also provides some unique extensions for C++ code to take advantage of specific Fortran capabilities. In this blog post, we will explore some of these extensions and how they can enhance your C++ programming experience.

## 1. MODULE procedure

In Fortran, the `MODULE` keyword is used to define a module that can contain variables, types, and procedures. The NAG Fortran Compiler allows you to use the `MODULE` keyword in C++ code to create Fortran-like modules. This can be particularly useful when you want to encapsulate related variables and functions in a single entity.

```cpp
MODULE myModule
{
    // Define variables
    int myVariable;
    float anotherVariable;

    // Define procedures
    void myProcedure()
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

With this extension, you can organize your code more effectively and improve its readability and maintainability.

## 2. FORALL statement

The `FORALL` statement in Fortran allows concise and efficient array operations. The NAG Fortran Compiler introduces a similar construct in C++ to leverage this functionality. The `FORALL` statement can simplify code that involves operations on arrays by providing a compact and expressive syntax.

```cpp
int main()
{
    float a[10], b[10], c[10];

    // Initialize a and b arrays

    FORALL(i : 1:10)
    {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }

    // Rest of the code
}
```

By using the `FORALL` statement, you can perform array operations more efficiently and concisely, improving both code readability and execution performance.

## Conclusion

The NAG Fortran Compiler offers unique extensions for C++ code, allowing you to take advantage of Fortran-specific features in your C++ projects. The `MODULE` keyword enables you to create modules to encapsulate related variables and procedures, enhancing code organization and maintainability. Additionally, the `FORALL` statement simplifies array operations, providing a more concise and efficient syntax.

Using these NAG Fortran Compiler-specific extensions for C++ can enhance your programming experience and improve the performance and readability of your code. Give them a try and see how they can benefit your projects!
