COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a programming language commonly used for business applications. IBM's Enterprise COBOL Compiler provides a set of extensions to the standard COBOL language that enhances its capabilities and allows developers to take advantage of advanced features.

In this blog post, we will explore some of the key IBM Enterprise COBOL Compiler-specific extensions and how they can benefit COBOL developers.

## 1. Compiler Directives

Compiler directives are special statements that provide additional instructions to the compiler. The IBM Enterprise COBOL Compiler introduces several directives that can influence the behavior of the compiled code.

**#SET** directive: This directive allows developers to set specific compiler options within the source program itself. It provides a way to control various compile-time options, such as optimization levels, debugging options, and character set handling.

_Example:_

```cobol
       *> #SET OPTIMIZE(O2)
```
**#DEBUG** directive: This directive enables debugging features for the compiled program. It allows developers to control the level of detail in the generated debug information, making it easier to debug COBOL programs during runtime.

_Example:_

```cobol
       *> #DEBUG LEVEL(2)
```

## 2. Language Extensions

IBM Enterprise COBOL Compiler also introduces several language extensions that enhance the expressiveness and functionality of the COBOL language.

**INLINE** clause: The INLINE clause allows developers to inline COBOL subroutines or functions directly into the calling program. Inlining can improve performance by eliminating subroutine calls overhead.

_Example:_

```cobol
       *> INLINE FUNCTION FUNCTION-NAME
```

**JNI (Java Native Interface) support**: Starting from Enterprise COBOL V6.4, IBM introduced support for the JNI, allowing COBOL programs to access and interact with Java classes, objects, and methods natively. This feature enables developers to leverage existing Java libraries and frameworks within their COBOL applications.

_Example:_

```cobol
        *> CALL 'JNI_ENV_CREATE_VM' USING BY VALUE vmArg, BY REFERENCE jniEnv POINTER 
```

## Conclusion

The IBM Enterprise COBOL Compiler-specific extensions provide COBOL developers with powerful tools to enhance and optimize their applications. Compiler directives enable fine-grained control over compilation options, while language extensions such as INLINE and JNI support allow for improved performance and integration with other technologies.

By leveraging these extensions, developers can maximize the potential of their COBOL applications and ensure they are capable of meeting the increasing demands of the modern business landscape.
