In C++, you might be familiar with constructors that are used to initialize objects of a class. However, did you know that you can also have static constructors in C++? Static constructors are special member functions that are automatically called when the program starts, even before any objects from the class are created.

Static constructors are useful when you need to perform initialization tasks that are shared among all instances of a class or need to set up some global state before the program starts. Here's how you can define and use static constructors in C++:

## Definition of a Static Constructor

A static constructor is declared inside a class, just like any other member function. The key difference is that it has the `static` keyword in front of its declaration. Here's an example:

```cpp
class MyClass {
  public:
    static void static_constructor() {
        // initialization tasks
    }
};
```

## Invoking a Static Constructor

Unlike regular constructors that are called explicitly when creating an object, static constructors are invoked automatically before `main()` starts execution. You don't need to call them explicitly. The compiler ensures that the static constructor is called before any other code is executed.

## Example Usage

Let's say you have a class called `Logger`, and you want to initialize a log file and perform some startup configuration before any object of the class is created. By using a static constructor, you can achieve this easily:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Logger {
  public:
    Logger() {
        std::cout << "Normal constructor called\n";
    }

    static void static_constructor() {
        std::cout << "Static constructor called\n";
        // Perform initialization tasks
        // Open log file, configure logging options, etc.
    }
};

int main() {
    // Initialize Logger class using a static constructor
    Logger::static_constructor();

    // Create an object of the Logger class
    Logger logger;

    // Rest of your program logic
    // ...
}
```

In the example above, the static constructor `static_constructor()` is called before the `main()` function. You can see the output indicating that the static constructor is invoked before the normal constructor is called.

Having a static constructor allows you to set up important initialization tasks that should be performed early in the program's lifecycle. It provides a convenient way to handle common setup tasks that need to be done before any objects of a class are created.
