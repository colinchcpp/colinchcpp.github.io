In C++, constructors play a crucial role in providing exception safety guarantees. Exception safety refers to the ability of a program to handle exceptions gracefully and in a way that preserves program integrity. In this blog post, we will explore the different types of exception guarantees and how to implement them in constructors.

## Types of Exception Guarantees

### 1. No-Throw Guarantee

A constructor with a no-throw guarantee ensures that it will never throw an exception under any circumstances. This guarantee is useful in scenarios where exceptions are not allowed or cannot be handled. To implement this guarantee, designate the constructor as `noexcept`.

**Example:**

```cpp
class NoThrowConstructor {
public:
  NoThrowConstructor() noexcept {
    // Constructor code here
  }
};
```

### 2. Basic Guarantee

A constructor with a basic guarantee ensures that if an exception is thrown, the object will be in a well-defined state. However, some resources may have been allocated and need to be properly cleaned up to avoid leaking. To achieve this guarantee, allocate resources in the constructor and use proper exception handling to release them if an exception occurs.

**Example:**

```cpp
class BasicConstructor {
public:
  BasicConstructor() {
    // Allocate resources
    resource = new Resource();

    try {
      // Constructor code here
    } catch (...) {
      // Clean up resources if exception occurs
      delete resource;
      throw;
    }
  }

  ~BasicConstructor() {
    // Release resources
    delete resource;
  }

private:
  Resource* resource;
};
```

### 3. Strong Guarantee

A constructor with a strong guarantee ensures that if an exception is thrown, the object remains unchanged. If an exception occurs, the constructor will undo any modifications and leave the object in its original state. To implement this guarantee, use a temporary object and swap it with the current object at the end of the constructor if no exceptions occur.

**Example:**

```cpp
class StrongConstructor {
public:
  StrongConstructor() {
    // Create temporary object
    StrongConstructor temp;

    // Constructor code here

    // Swap temporary object with current object
    swap(temp);
  }

private:
  void swap(StrongConstructor& other) {
    // Perform swap operation
  }
};
```

### 4. No Guarantee

A constructor with no guarantee provides no guarantees as to the state of the object if an exception occurs during construction. It is up to the caller to handle the exception and clean up any resources if necessary. Constructors with no guarantee are typically used when dealing with low-level operations or external dependencies.

## Conclusion

Constructors in C++ can provide different levels of exception safety guarantees to ensure program integrity in the face of exceptions. By understanding the different types of guarantees and implementing them appropriately, you can write safer and more robust code.
