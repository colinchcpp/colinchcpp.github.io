In object-oriented programming, constructors are special member functions that are used to initialize objects of a class. They are called automatically when an object is created. Constructors are typically used to set initial values for the data members of the class.

In C++, constructors can be defined with or without parameters. In the case of dynamic constructors, the constructor is used to allocate memory dynamically and initialize the object.

To create a dynamic constructor, we can use the `new` operator to allocate memory for the object. Let's take a look at an example:

```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int* data;

public:
    MyClass(int val) {
        data = new int;
        *data = val;
    }

    void printValue() {
        std::cout << "Value: " << *data << std::endl;
        delete data;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass* obj = new MyClass(10);
    obj->printValue();
    delete obj;

    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, we have a `MyClass` with a dynamic constructor that takes an `int` parameter. Inside the constructor, we allocate memory for the `data` member using the `new` operator and assign the passed value to it.

The `printValue` function is used to print the value of `data` and deallocate the memory allocated by the dynamic constructor using the `delete` operator.

In the `main` function, we create an object of `MyClass` using the dynamic constructor by using the `new` operator. We call the `printValue` function to print the value and then delete the object using the `delete` operator to free the allocated memory.

Using dynamic constructors provides flexibility in allocating memory as per the requirement and initializing objects with user-defined values. It allows us to control the lifetime of objects in a dynamic manner.
