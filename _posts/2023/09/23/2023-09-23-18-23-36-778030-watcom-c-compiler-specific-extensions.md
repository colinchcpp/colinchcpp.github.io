The Watcom C++ compiler, also known as Open Watcom, is a widely used compiler that supports a variety of platforms and provides a range of extensions beyond the standard C and C++ language features. These extensions can be useful for developers looking to leverage advanced features or target specific platforms. In this blog post, we will explore some of the notable Watcom C++ compiler-specific extensions.

## 1. `__declspec` specifier

The `__declspec` specifier is a Watcom-specific extension that allows the programmer to specify attributes for functions, variables, or types. This specifier is similar to the Microsoft Visual C++ `__declspec` extension, but there are some differences.

For example, the `__declspec(dllexport)` attribute can be used to export functions or variables from a DLL. This can be useful when creating shared libraries or when interfacing with external code.

```cpp
__declspec(dllexport) void MyFunction();

__declspec(dllexport) int MyVariable = 42;
```

## 2. `__cdecl` calling convention

The default calling convention in Watcom C++ is `__cdecl`, which specifies that the caller is responsible for cleaning up the stack after calling a function. This convention is commonly used for compatibility with C code or when calling functions that have a variable number of arguments.

```cpp
void __cdecl MyFunction(int a, int b);

int result = __cdecl MyFunction(10, 20);
```

## Conclusion

These are just a few examples of the Watcom C++ Compiler-specific extensions available. The Watcom compiler provides a range of features and options that can help programmers in their development process. By leveraging these extensions, developers can create more efficient and platform-specific code.
