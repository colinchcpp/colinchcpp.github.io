Exception handling is an essential aspect of writing robust and error-free code in C++. However, handling pointers in exception scenarios requires some extra care to avoid creating dangling pointers. A dangling pointer is a pointer that points to a memory location that has been deallocated or deleted, leading to undefined behavior when accessed. In this blog post, we will explore some best practices for safely handling pointers in exception handling to prevent dangling pointers.

## 1. Use Smart Pointers
**Smart pointers** are objects that behave like pointers but provide automatic memory management. They handle deallocating memory when it is no longer needed, making them a safer option for managing dynamic memory allocation. Specifically, using **unique_ptr** and **shared_ptr** can help prevent dangling pointers in case of exceptions.

Instead of using raw pointers, use unique_ptr when you have exclusive ownership of the object and shared_ptr when the ownership is shared among multiple pointers. Smart pointers ensure that the memory is automatically deallocated when the last pointer referencing it goes out of scope.

Here's an example of using unique_ptr:

```cpp
#include <memory>

void someFunction()
{
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr(new int(42));

    // Perform some operations

    // If an exception is thrown, unique_ptr will automatically deallocate the memory
}
```

## 2. Reset Pointers to Null in Exception Handlers
Another way to avoid creating dangling pointers in the presence of exceptions is to explicitly set pointers to `nullptr` in exception handlers. This prevents accessing deleted memory and ensures that the pointers are in a well-defined state after an exception occurs.

Consider the following example:

```cpp
int* createIntArray(size_t size)
{
    int* arr = new int[size];

    // Some allocation and initialization

    return arr;
}

void exampleFunction()
{
    int* ptr = nullptr;

    try
    {
        ptr = createIntArray(10);
        // Perform some operations
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        delete[] ptr;  // Safely deallocate memory if an exception is thrown
        ptr = nullptr; // Reset pointer to nullptr
        throw;         // Re-throw the exception
    }

    delete[] ptr; // Deallocate memory outside of the try-catch block
}
```

By explicitly setting the pointer to `nullptr` in the exception handler, we ensure that the pointer does not become a dangling pointer if an exception occurs before memory deallocation.

## Conclusion
Handling pointers safely in exception scenarios is crucial to prevent dangling pointers and avoid undefined behavior. By using smart pointers and resetting pointers to `nullptr` in exception handlers, you can write more reliable and robust code. Incorporating these best practices into your C++ programming can help you avoid memory leaks and ensure proper exception handling.
