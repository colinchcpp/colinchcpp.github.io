## 1. Nullify Pointers after Deallocation
After deallocating memory using `delete` or `delete[]`, it is crucial to set the pointer to `nullptr` to avoid it becoming a dangling pointer. By setting the pointer to `nullptr`, you prevent accidentally accessing the deallocated memory through that pointer.

```cpp
int* ptr = new int;
// ... Code using ptr
delete ptr;
ptr = nullptr; // Nullify the pointer
```

## 2. Use Smart Pointers
Smart pointers are a feature introduced in C++11 that automatically manage the lifetime of dynamically allocated objects. They can help prevent the creation of dangling pointers by ensuring that the memory is deallocated when it is no longer needed. There are three kinds of smart pointers in C++: `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr`.

- `std::unique_ptr` is used when ownership of the object is unique and does not need to be shared. It automatically deallocates the memory when the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope.
```cpp
std::unique_ptr<int> uniquePtr = std::make_unique<int>(42);
// ... Code using uniquePtr
uniquePtr.reset(); // Memory is automatically deallocated
```

- `std::shared_ptr` is used when multiple pointers need to share ownership of the object. It keeps track of the number of references and deallocates the memory only when the last reference goes out of scope.
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<int> sharedPtr = std::make_shared<int>(42);
// ... Code using sharedPtr
sharedPtr.reset(); // Memory is deallocated only if no more references exist
```

- `std::weak_ptr` is used in combination with `std::shared_ptr` to overcome circular dependencies. It provides a non-owning reference to a `std::shared_ptr` without affecting its reference count.
```cpp
std::weak_ptr<int> weakPtr;
{
    std::shared_ptr<int> sharedPtr = std::make_shared<int>(42);
    weakPtr = sharedPtr;
    // ... Code using sharedPtr and weakPtr
}
// Memory is deallocated when sharedPtr goes out of scope, weakPtr becomes invalid
```

By using smart pointers, you can avoid manual memory deallocation and minimize the chance of dangling pointers in your code.

## Conclusion
Dangling pointers can cause hard-to-debug issues in C++ programs. By adopting good memory management practices, such as nullifying pointers after deallocation and using smart pointers, you can effectively avoid dangling pointer problems. Be mindful of your memory allocations and deallocations to ensure the stability and correctness of your code.
