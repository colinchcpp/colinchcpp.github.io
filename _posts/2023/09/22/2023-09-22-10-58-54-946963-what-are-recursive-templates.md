This approach is commonly implemented in scenarios where the content has a hierarchical structure, such as menus, file directories, or comment threads. It allows developers to write a single template that can be reused for each level of the hierarchy without knowing in advance how deep the nesting will go.

To understand how recursive templates work, consider a file directory structure. Each directory can contain subdirectories, which can further contain more subdirectories, and so on. With a recursive template, you can define a template that represents a single directory and then call that template within itself to render the subdirectories.

Here is an example of a recursive template for rendering a file directory:

```html
{% template directory %}
  <ul>
    {% for file in directory.files %}
      {% if file.is_directory %}
        <li>
          {{ file.name }}
          {% include directory with directory=file %}
        </li>
      {% else %}
        <li>{{ file.name }}</li>
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endtemplate %}
```

In this example, the `directory` template is defined to render a list of files. It checks if each file is a directory and if so, includes the `directory` template again for the subdirectory. This process continues recursively until all levels of the directory structure are rendered.

Recursive templates offer a flexible and efficient way to handle complex and dynamically nested structures. However, it's essential to handle the termination condition properly to avoid infinite loops. By utilizing recursive templates effectively, developers can create scalable and hierarchical content structures in their web applications.
