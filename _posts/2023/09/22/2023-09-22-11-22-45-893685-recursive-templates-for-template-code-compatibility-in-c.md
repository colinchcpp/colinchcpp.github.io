In C++, templates are a powerful feature that allow us to write code that can be used with different data types. However, when working with complex template code, it can sometimes be challenging to ensure compatibility between different templates. One solution to this problem is to use recursive templates.

Recursive templates allow us to define a template that can handle a generic type, and then recursively apply the template to sub-types if needed. This approach can be really useful in cases where we have nested types or hierarchies of types.

Let's take a look at an example to better understand how recursive templates work. Suppose we want to define a template function `print` that can print the elements of a container, regardless of its type.

```cpp
template <typename T>
void print(const T& container)
{
    for(const auto& element : container)
    {
        std::cout << element << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
```

This template function works well for most containers like `std::vector` or `std::list`. However, if we have a nested container, such as a vector of vectors, the code will not compile.

To make our `print` function compatible with nested containers, we can use a recursive template approach. Here's an updated version of the function:

```cpp
template <typename T>
void print(const T& container)
{
    for(const auto& element : container)
    {
        print(element);
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

template <typename T>
void print(const std::vector<T>& container)
{
    for(const auto& element : container)
    {
        std::cout << element << " ";
    }
}
```

In the updated version, we added a new template function that handles the case where the container is a `std::vector`. This function is called recursively until we reach a non-nested container, and then the elements are printed.

With this recursive template approach, we can now use our `print` function with nested containers as well. For example:

```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<int>> nested = {{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {6}};
print(nested); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

By using recursive templates, we can achieve template code compatibility and handle complex container types without compromising the flexibility and power of C++ templates.
