In C++, exception handling is an essential feature for writing robust and fault-tolerant code. When an exception is thrown, the program executes the nearest matching `catch` block that can handle the exception. However, at times, we may encounter scenarios where we want to handle different types of exceptions in a similar way.

To handle multiple exception types with a common handler, we can leverage the power of recursive templates. Recursive templates allow us to define a common exception handling mechanism that can handle exceptions of different types in a unified manner.

```c++
template<typename ExceptionType>
void HandleException(const ExceptionType& ex)
{
    // Common exception handling logic
    // ...
}

template<typename FirstExceptionType, typename... RestExceptionTypes>
void HandleException(const FirstExceptionType& ex, RestExceptionTypes... rest)
{
    HandleException(ex); // Call the common handler for the first exception
    HandleException(rest...); // Recursively call the handler for the remaining exceptions
}
```

In the above code, we define two overloaded template functions: `HandleException`. The first function takes a single exception object as a parameter and handles it in a common way. The second function is a recursive template that takes multiple exception objects as parameters. It calls the `HandleException` function for the first exception and recursively calls itself for the remaining exceptions.

This approach allows us to handle different types of exceptions using a single function call, simplifying the exception handling code. It also provides a centralized location for modifying the common exception handling logic.

Let's see an example of how we can leverage recursive templates for exception handling:

```c++
try
{
    // Code that may throw exceptions
}
catch(const ExceptionType1& ex1, const ExceptionType2& ex2, const ExceptionType3& ex3)
{
    HandleException(ex1, ex2, ex3);
}
```
By using recursive templates, we can handle exceptions of `ExceptionType1`, `ExceptionType2`, and `ExceptionType3` in a unified way.

In conclusion, recursive templates in C++ provide a powerful mechanism for handling multiple exception types with a common handler. It streamlines exception handling code, promotes code reusability, and centralizes the exception handling logic.
