Have you ever encountered a situation where you have a template code that needs to be decompressed at compile-time? This can happen when you have a compressed representation of a template code and you want to generate the actual code at compile-time. In such cases, recursive templates can be a powerful tool.

## What are Recursive Templates?

Recursive templates in C++ refer to the technique of using templates that call themselves during compilation. This allows for the generation of code based on a recursive algorithm. In the context of template code decompression, recursive templates can be used to expand the compressed template code into the actual code.

## Implementing Recursive Template Decompression

To illustrate the concept, let's consider a simple example where we have a compressed representation of a template function that adds two integers:

```cpp
template <int K>
struct CompressedAdd {
    static const int value = K + 1;
};
```

In this example, the template parameter `K` represents the compressed integer value. Our goal is to decompress this code at compile-time to generate the actual addition function `Add`.

Here's how we can use recursive templates to achieve this:

```cpp
// Base template
template <int K>
struct DecompressedAdd {
    static const int value = K;
};

// Recursive template
template <int K>
struct DecompressedAddHelper {
    static const int value = DecompressedAdd<K - 1>::value + 1;
};

// Specialization for termination
template <>
struct DecompressedAdd<0> {
    static const int value = 0;
};

// Usage
int main() {
    constexpr int result = DecompressedAdd<5>::value;
    std::cout << result << std::endl; // Output: 5
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we have two template structs: `DecompressedAdd` and `DecompressedAddHelper`. `DecompressedAdd` is the base template that represents the decompressed code. The `DecompressedAddHelper` template calls itself recursively until it reaches the termination condition (`DecompressedAdd<0>`). Each recursive call increments the value by 1 until the termination condition is reached.

By providing the desired compressed value as the template parameter, we can access the decompressed value using the `value` member variable.

## Conclusion

Recursive templates are a powerful technique in C++ that allow for the generation of code at compile-time. In the context of template code decompression, recursive templates can be used to expand compressed template code into the actual code. By leveraging recursive calls and termination conditions, we can achieve a recursive template that decompresses the template code. This technique can be handy in scenarios where compressed template code needs to be expanded at compile-time.
