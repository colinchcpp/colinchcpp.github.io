Compression and decompression algorithms are essential in many applications that deal with large files or limited storage space. By using custom file compression techniques, we can optimize file sizes while maintaining data integrity. In this article, we will explore how to overload operators in C++ to implement custom file compression and decompression.

## Understanding Operator Overloading

Operator overloading allows us to define how operators behave with objects of a class. This enables us to perform custom operations on user-defined types, making our code more intuitive and expressive. By overloading operators, we can extend the functionality of built-in operators such as +, -, *, /, and more.

## Implementing File Compression/Decompression

To implement file compression and decompression in C++, we'll define a class that holds the compressed data and provides overloaded operators for compression and decompression operations.

```cpp
class CompressedFile {
private:
    std::vector<unsigned char> data;

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the compressed file object
    CompressedFile(const std::vector<unsigned char>& compressedData) : data(compressedData) {}

    // Overloaded + operator for compression operation
    CompressedFile operator+(const std::string& fileContent) {
        // Perform compression operation on fileContent and append it to the existing data
        // ...

        // Return a new CompressedFile object with the updated data
        return CompressedFile(updatedData);
    }

    // Overloaded - operator for decompression operation
    std::string operator-(const CompressedFile& compressedFile) {
        // Perform decompression operation on the compressedFile.data and get the original file content
        // ...

        // Return the decompressed file content
        return fileContent;
    }
};
```

In the above example, we have a `CompressedFile` class that holds the compressed data as a `std::vector<unsigned char>`. We have overloaded the `+` operator to perform compression and the `-` operator to perform decompression.

To compress a file, we can create a `CompressedFile` object and use the overloaded `+` operator to append the compressed data to it. 

```cpp
CompressedFile compressedData;
std::string fileContent = readFile("input.txt");
compressedData = compressedData + fileContent;
```

Similarly, to decompress a file, we can use the `-` operator and pass a `CompressedFile` object that holds the compressed data.

```cpp
CompressedFile compressedData = getCompressedData();
std::string originalContent = compressedData - compressedData;
writeFile("output.txt", originalContent);
```

## Summary

By overloading operators in C++, we can implement custom file compression and decompression operations. This approach enables us to write more intuitive code and handle file compression tasks with ease. With the proper implementation and optimization techniques, we can efficiently compress and decompress files while maintaining data integrity.
