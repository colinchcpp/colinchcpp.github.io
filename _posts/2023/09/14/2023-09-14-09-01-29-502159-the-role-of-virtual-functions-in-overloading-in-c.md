In object-oriented programming, polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of the same type. One of the key mechanisms to achieve polymorphism in C++ is through the use of virtual functions. Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called at runtime, based on the actual object type rather than the pointer or reference type. 

## Overloading and Polymorphism ##

In C++, function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters to coexist. Overloaded functions are resolved at compile-time based on the number, types, and order of the parameters. However, if we have a pointer or reference to a base class object holding derived class objects, and we call an overloaded function using that pointer or reference, the function resolved would be the one defined in the base class, rather than the derived class. This is not desirable if we want to achieve runtime polymorphism.

## Introduction to Virtual Functions ##

Virtual functions in C++ are a mechanism to override base class functions in derived classes. By declaring a function as virtual in the base class, we allow derived classes to provide their own implementation of the function. This allows the function call to be resolved at runtime based on the type of the object being pointed or referenced.

## Using Virtual Functions for Overloading ##

To use virtual functions for overloading, we define a base class with a virtual function, and then define the same function in the derived classes with their respective implementations. When a virtual function is called using a pointer or reference to a base class object holding a derived class object, the specific implementation corresponding to the actual object type is called.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of virtual functions for overloading in C++:

```cpp
#include<iostream>

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() {
        std::cout << "Drawing a shape\n";
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        std::cout << "Drawing a circle\n";
    }
};

class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        std::cout << "Drawing a square\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shape1 = new Circle();
    Shape* shape2 = new Square();

    shape1->draw();
    shape2->draw();

    delete shape1;
    delete shape2;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` class is the base class, and the `Circle` and `Square` classes are derived classes. The `draw()` function is declared as virtual in the base class and overridden in the derived classes. When we call the `draw()` function using a pointer to the base class, the correct implementation is called based on the object type.

## Conclusion ##

Virtual functions in C++ play a crucial role in achieving polymorphism by allowing functions to be resolved at runtime based on the actual object type. By using virtual functions, we can ensure that overloaded functions are correctly called when using pointers or references to base class objects holding derived class objects. This provides flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented programming, making C++ a powerful language for implementing polymorphic behavior.
