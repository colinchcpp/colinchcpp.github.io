1. Use const-correctness: Whenever possible, declare your overloaded operators as const member functions. This ensures that the objects being operated on are not modified, improving code safety and maintainability. For example:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass operator+(const MyClass& other) const {
        // implementation
    }
};
```

2. Return objects by value: In C++, it is generally preferred to return a new object as the result of an overloaded operator, rather than modifying one of the operands. This allows users to chain operations and provides a more intuitive interface. For example:

```cpp
class Vector {
public:
    Vector operator+(const Vector& other) const {
        // implementation
    }
};

Vector v1, v2, v3;
v3 = v1 + v2;
```

3. Handle self-assignment properly: Be cautious when handling self-assignment within overloaded operators. Make sure to check that the objects being operated on are not the same before performing any modifications. This prevents unintended consequences and eliminates unnecessary computations. For example:

```cpp
class Matrix {
public:
    Matrix& operator+=(const Matrix& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            // implementation
        }
        
        return *this;
    }
};

Matrix m1, m2;
m1 += m2; // safe even if m1 and m2 are the same object
```

4. Avoid excessive copying: When designing overloaded operators that involve heavy objects, like matrices or strings, consider using pass-by-reference rather than pass-by-value. This avoids unnecessary copying and improves performance. For example:

```cpp
class Matrix {
public:
    Matrix& operator+=(const Matrix& other) {
        // implementation
        return *this;
    }
    
    // Other operators using pass-by-reference
};

Matrix m1, m2;
m1 += m2;
```

5. Follow intuitive conventions: It is essential to follow conventions and behavior that users of your code would expect from built-in operators. For example, overloading the addition operator (`+`) to concatenate strings or perform numeric addition, rather than using it for subtraction. Following intuitive conventions enhances code readability and reduces confusion for other developers.

In conclusion, designing overloaded operators in C++ requires careful consideration of const-correctness, return types, self-assignment, minimizing excessive copying, and following intuitive conventions. By applying these best practices, you can ensure that your code is efficient, maintainable, and adheres to standard conventions. Happy coding!
