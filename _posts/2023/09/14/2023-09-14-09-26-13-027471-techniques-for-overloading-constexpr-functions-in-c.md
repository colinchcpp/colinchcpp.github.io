In C++, `constexpr` functions are evaluated at compile time, allowing for efficient computations and enhancements in performance. They can be used to perform calculations, generate constants, and make decisions based on compile-time values. Overloading `constexpr` functions adds flexibility and enables us to handle different input types or parameters.

Here are two techniques for overloading `constexpr` functions in C++:

## 1. Overload Based on Parameter Type

One way to overload a `constexpr` function is by distinguishing it based on the parameter type. This allows us to have different behavior depending on the type of the arguments.

```cpp
constexpr int calculateSquare(int num) {
    return num * num;
}

constexpr double calculateSquare(double num) {
    return num * num;
}
```

In the above example, we have overloaded the `calculateSquare` function based on the parameter type. The first overload works for integers, while the second overload works for floating-point numbers.

## 2. Overload Based on Number of Parameters

Another technique for overloading `constexpr` functions is to differentiate them based on the number of parameters they accept. This allows us to handle different cases or scenarios based on the arity of the function.

```cpp
constexpr int sum(int a) {
    return a;
}

constexpr int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

constexpr int sum(int a, int b, int c) {
    return a + b + c;
}
```

In the example above, we have overloaded the `sum` function based on the number of parameters. We can now call the function with one, two, or three arguments, and the appropriate overload will be invoked.

Using these techniques, we can create `constexpr` functions that provide different behavior based on parameter types or the number of parameters. This allows for more flexibility and powerful compile-time computations.

Remember to mark the function overload with `constexpr` if the operations inside the function can be evaluated at compile time.
