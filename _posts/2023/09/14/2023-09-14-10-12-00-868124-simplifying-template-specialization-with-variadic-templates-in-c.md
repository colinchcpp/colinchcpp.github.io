Template specialization is a powerful feature in C++ that allows us to define different implementations for a generic template based on specific types. However, when dealing with multiple template parameters, the process of defining and maintaining template specializations can become cumbersome and error-prone. 

Fortunately, with the introduction of variadic templates in C++11, the process of template specialization has been greatly simplified. Variadic templates allow us to define templates that can accept a variable number of template arguments.

Let's consider an example where we have a generic `Container` class template that we want to specialize for different types. In traditional C++, we would need to define separate specialization for each specific type:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class Container
{
    // generic implementation
};

template <>
class Container<int>
{
    // specialization for int
};

template <>
class Container<double>
{
    // specialization for double
};

template <>
class Container<std::string>
{
    // specialization for std::string
};
```

With variadic templates, we can simplify this process by using a single template definition and utilizing pattern matching on the template arguments to specialize the class:

```cpp
template <typename... Args>
class Container
{
    // generic implementation
};

template <typename T, typename... Args>
class Container<T, Args...>
{
    // specialization for T
};

```

In this example, the primary template `Container<Args...>` serves as the generic implementation for any number of template arguments. The specialized template `Container<T, Args...>` captures the first type `T` and the remaining arguments `Args...`.

By leveraging this approach, we can easily specialize the `Container` class for multiple types without the need for separate declaration and implementation. For instance, to specialize `Container` for `int` and `double`, we can simply write:

```cpp
template <>
class Container<int>
{
    // specialization for int
};

template <>
class Container<double>
{
    // specialization for double
};
```

The variadic template feature simplifies the code, reduces duplication, and enhances code maintainability.

In summary, variadic templates in C++ allows us to streamline the process of template specialization. By employing a single template definition and matching patterns on the template arguments, we can easily specialize generic templates for multiple types. This results in cleaner and more concise code.
