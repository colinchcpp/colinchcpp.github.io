```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Functor class
class PointerLikeFunctor {
public:
    // Overloading function call operator
    int operator()(int value) {
        return value * 2;
    }
};

int main() {
    PointerLikeFunctor functor;

    // Call the functor as if it were a function
    int result = functor(5);

    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;  // Output: Result: 10

    return 0;
}
```

In C++, functors are objects that act like functions. They can be called using the same syntax as a function, which makes them powerful and flexible. One interesting use of functors is to achieve pointer-like behavior.

Pointers in C++ allow us to indirectly access and manipulate memory. They can be assigned a memory address and can be dereferenced to access the value stored at that address. Functors can mimic this behavior by overloading the function call operator (`operator()`).

In the code above, we define a simple functor class called `PointerLikeFunctor`. This class overloads the function call operator and doubles the given value. When calling an instance of this functor, it behaves as if we are calling a function that doubles the input.

In the `main()` function, we create an object of the `PointerLikeFunctor` class. We then call the functor object with the value 5, just like a regular function. The result is stored in the `result` variable and printed to the console, which outputs "Result: 10".

This demonstrates how functors can be used to achieve pointer-like behavior in C++. By overloading the function call operator, we can effectively treat a functor object as if it were a function or a pointer. This technique can be useful in various scenarios, such as custom memory management or implementing callback functions. Functors provide a flexible and powerful way to encapsulate behavior and act as function-like objects.
