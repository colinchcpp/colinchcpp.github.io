Functors in C++ are objects or classes that can be used as function pointers. They are versatile and can be used to encapsulate the logic and behavior of a mathematical operation. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement functor classes to perform common mathematical operations using C++.

## What is a Functor?

A functor is an object that can be treated as a function. It overloads the `operator()` and can be called as if it were a function. Functors can have state and can be passed as arguments to algorithms or stored in data structures.

```cpp
class AddFunctor {
public:
    int operator()(int a, int b) const {
        return a + b;
    }
};
```

The `operator()` function behaves like a function and performs the addition operation. We can create an instance of the `AddFunctor` class and call it like a regular function:

```cpp
AddFunctor add;
int result = add(2, 3);  // Result = 5
```

## Implementing Functor Classes for Mathematical Operations

Let's implement a few functor classes for different mathematical operations:

### Addition Functor

```cpp
class AddFunctor {
public:
    int operator()(int a, int b) const {
        return a + b;
    }
};
```

Usage:

```cpp
AddFunctor add;
int result = add(2, 3);  // Result = 5
```

### Subtraction Functor

```cpp
class SubtractFunctor {
public:
    int operator()(int a, int b) const {
        return a - b;
    }
};
```

Usage:

```cpp
SubtractFunctor subtract;
int result = subtract(5, 3);  // Result = 2
```

### Multiplication Functor

```cpp
class MultiplyFunctor {
public:
    int operator()(int a, int b) const {
        return a * b;
    }
};
```

Usage:

```cpp
MultiplyFunctor multiply;
int result = multiply(2, 3);  // Result = 6
```

### Division Functor

```cpp
class DivideFunctor {
public:
    double operator()(double a, double b) const {
        return a / b;
    }
};
```

Usage:

```cpp
DivideFunctor divide;
double result = divide(10.0, 2.0);  // Result = 5.0
```

## Conclusion

By implementing functor classes, we can encapsulate the behavior of mathematical operations. Functors provide a flexible way to represent functions as objects, allowing us to customize behavior and pass them as arguments to algorithms. This approach enhances code modularity and reusability.

Implementing functor classes in C++ is a powerful technique for handling mathematical operations and can greatly improve the clarity and maintainability of your code.
