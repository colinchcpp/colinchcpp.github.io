When working with custom data structures in C++, it is often necessary to compare objects using relational operators (such as `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`). However, the default behavior of these operators may not be suitable for your custom data structure. In such cases, you can *overload* these operators to define your own comparison logic.

## Why Overload Relational Operators? ##

Overloading relational operators allows you to define how your custom data structures should be compared. This enables you to create meaningful comparisons based on the specific attributes or properties of your objects. For example, if you have a `Person` class with `age` and `name` attributes, you may want to compare these objects based on their ages rather than their names.

## Overloading the Operators ##

To overload the relational operators, you need to define them as member functions or global functions outside the class. Here's an example of overloading the `==` operator for a `Point` class:

```cpp
class Point {
    int x, y;

public:
    Point(int x = 0, int y = 0) : x(x), y(y) {}

    // Overloading the == operator
    bool operator==(const Point& other) const {
        return x == other.x && y == other.y;
    }
};
```

In the above code, we define the `operator==` as a member function that takes a constant reference to another `Point` object. We then compare the `x` and `y` values of both objects and return `true` if they are equal, and `false` otherwise.

Similarly, you can overload other relational operators, such as `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. Keep in mind that some operators may have dependencies on other operators. For example, if you overload the `<` operator, you should also overload the `==` and `>` operators as well, as they are often used together.

## Usage Example ##

Once you have overloaded the desired relational operators, you can use them just like you would use the built-in operators. Here's an example of using the overloaded `==` operator for the `Point` class:

```cpp
Point p1(1, 2);
Point p2(3, 4);
Point p3(1, 2);

if (p1 == p2) {
    cout << "p1 and p2 are equal" << endl;
}

if (p1 == p3) {
    cout << "p1 and p3 are equal" << endl;
}
```

In this example, the first `if` condition will evaluate to `false`, as `p1` and `p2` have different coordinates. However, the second `if` condition will evaluate to `true`, as `p1` and `p3` have the same coordinates.

## Conclusion ##

Overloading relational operators in C++ allows you to define custom comparison logic for your own data structures. By doing so, you can make your code more expressive and tailored to your specific needs. Remember to consider the dependencies between operators and maintain consistency when overloading multiple operators.
