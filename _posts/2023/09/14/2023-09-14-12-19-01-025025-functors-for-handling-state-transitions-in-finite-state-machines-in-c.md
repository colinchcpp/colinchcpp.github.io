Finite State Machines (FSMs) are a powerful way to model complex systems, especially in programming. They provide a structured approach to handle state transitions and are widely used in various applications. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of functors in C++ and how they can be used to handle state transitions in FSMs.

## What are Functors?

In C++, functors are objects that can be treated as if they were functions. They are instances of a class that overrides the function call operator `operator()` allowing it to be used as if it were a function. Functors offer more flexibility and can store state, making them ideal for handling state transitions in FSMs.

## Finite State Machines

A Finite State Machine is a mathematical abstraction used to model systems that have a finite number of states and transitions between those states. It consists of states, events, and transition rules. Events trigger state transitions, and based on the current state and the event, the machine moves to the next state according to predefined rules.

## Using Functors for State Transitions

To implement a FSM using functors in C++, we can define a class for each state. Each state class will have a functor object that handles the state-specific logic and transitions. Here's an example implementation of a simple FSM using functors:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// State A
class StateA {
public:
    void operator()() {
        std::cout << "In State A." << std::endl;
        // Handle state-specific logic

        // Transition to state B
        // Call functor for state B
        StateB()();
    }
};

// State B
class StateB {
public:
    void operator()() {
        std::cout << "In State B." << std::endl;
        // Handle state-specific logic

        // Transition to state A
        // Call functor for state A
        StateA()();
    }
};

int main() {
    // Start with state A
    StateA state;
    state(); // Call functor for state A

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have two states: `StateA` and `StateB`. Each state is represented by a class with an overridden `operator()` that handles the state-specific logic. The `operator()` also triggers the state transition by calling the functor for the next state.

The `main()` function demonstrates how the FSM works. It starts with `StateA` and calls its functor, which prints "In State A" and transitions to `StateB` by invoking its functor. Similarly, `StateB` transitions back to `StateA`, creating a cyclic FSM.

## Conclusion

Using functors in C++ provides an elegant way to handle state transitions in Finite State Machines. Functors allow storing state and encapsulating state-specific logic within each state's class. With this approach, we can easily model complex systems and define the behavior of state transitions in a clear and modular manner.
