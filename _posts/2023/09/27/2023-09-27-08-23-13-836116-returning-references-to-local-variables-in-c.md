In C++, returning a reference to a local variable can be problematic because once the function or block ends, the local variable will be destroyed and the returned reference will become invalid. This can lead to undefined behavior or runtime errors. 

Let's take a look at an example to showcase this issue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int& getLocalVariable() {
    int num = 10;
    return num;
}

int main() {
    int& reference = getLocalVariable();
    std::cout << reference << std::endl; // Output: Unexpected results or runtime error
    return 0;
}
```

In the `getLocalVariable` function, we have a local variable `num` of type `int`. We then try to return a reference to this local variable. However, as soon as the `getLocalVariable` function ends, the `num` variable is destroyed, making the returned reference invalid.

In the `main` function, we assign the returned reference to `reference` and try to print its value. This can result in unexpected output or runtime errors since we are accessing a destroyed local variable.

To avoid this issue, you should not return references to local variables. Instead, consider using other methods like returning by value or using dynamic memory allocation. If you need to return a complex object or a large amount of data, it is recommended to use smart pointers or other resource management techniques to safely pass ownership and prevent memory leaks.

Remember to always pay attention to the scope and lifetime of your variables when writing C++ code to avoid unexpected behaviors.
