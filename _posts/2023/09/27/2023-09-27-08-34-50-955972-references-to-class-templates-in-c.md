When it comes to writing flexible and reusable code, class templates are a powerful feature in C++. They allow you to define a blueprint for classes that can work with different data types. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of working with class templates in C++ and discuss how they can benefit your programming projects.

### Defining a Class Template

To define a class template in C++, you use the `template` keyword followed by the template parameter. Here's an example of a simple class template that represents a generic stack:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class Stack {
private:
    T elements[100];
    int top;

public:
    Stack() : top(-1) {}

    void push(const T& value) {
        elements[++top] = value;
    }

    T pop() {
        return elements[top--];
    }

    bool isEmpty() const {
        return top == -1;
    }
};
```

In the above code, `T` is a placeholder for the type of elements that will be stored in the stack. It can be replaced with any valid C++ type, such as `int`, `float`, or even user-defined types.

### Using a Class Template

To use a class template, you simply need to provide the template arguments when creating an instance of the class. Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the `Stack` class template:

```cpp
int main() {
    Stack<int> intStack;
    intStack.push(10);
    intStack.push(20);
    intStack.push(30);

    while (!intStack.isEmpty()) {
        std::cout << intStack.pop() << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we created an instance of the `Stack` class template with the template argument `int`. This means that the `int` type will be used for storing elements in the stack.

### Benefits of Class Templates

Using class templates in C++ offers several benefits:

- **Code Reusability**: Class templates allow you to write generic code that can work with different data types, reducing the need to duplicate code for each specific type.

- **Flexibility**: Class templates provide flexibility, as you can use them with any valid C++ data type, including primitive types and user-defined types.

- **Type Safety**: Class templates ensure type safety by performing compile-time checks on the template arguments, minimizing the chances of runtime errors.

### Conclusion

Class templates in C++ provide a powerful mechanism for writing flexible and reusable code. By defining a class template, you can create classes that can work with different data types while benefiting from code reusability and type safety. So next time you find yourself needing to work with multiple types in your program, consider using class templates to simplify your code and improve its maintainability and flexibility.
