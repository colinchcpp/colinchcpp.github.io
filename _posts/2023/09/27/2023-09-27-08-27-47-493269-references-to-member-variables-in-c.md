To reference a member variable within a member function, you can use the `this` pointer. The `this` pointer is a special pointer that points to the current instance of the class. It allows you to access the member variables and member functions of the class using the arrow operator `->`.

Here's an example to illustrate how to reference member variables in C++:

```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int myInt; // Member variable

public:
    void setMyInt(int value) {
        this->myInt = value; // Using the this pointer to reference the member variable
    }

    int getMyInt() {
        return this->myInt; // Using the this pointer to access the member variable
    }
};
```

In the above code, we have a class named `MyClass` with a private member variable `myInt`. The `setMyInt` function sets the value of `myInt` using the `this` pointer and the arrow operator. Similarly, the `getMyInt` function returns the value of `myInt` using the `this` pointer.

When using the `this` pointer, it is optional to explicitly use it to reference the member variables. In most cases, you can directly use the member variable name within the member functions. However, using `this->` can make the code more readable and explicit, especially when there is a naming conflict between the member variable and a local variable or parameter within the function.

Referencing member variables correctly is crucial in C++ to ensure you are accessing the intended data and avoiding any unexpected behavior. By utilizing the `this` pointer, you can confidently access and manipulate member variables within your class methods.
