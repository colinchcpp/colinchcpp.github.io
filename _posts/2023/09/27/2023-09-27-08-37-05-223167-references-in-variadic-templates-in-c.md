Variadic templates are a powerful feature in C++ that allow functions and classes to accept an arbitrary number of arguments of different types. With variadic templates, you can create flexible code that can handle different function parameter lists without statically defining each possible combination.

One common use case for variadic templates is to pass and store references to objects. By passing references, you can avoid making unnecessary copies of objects, which can be beneficial for performance and memory usage.

To pass and store references in variadic templates, you need to be careful about the lifetime of the objects being referenced. If the objects being referenced are temporary or local variables, you need to ensure that they outlive the references.

Here's an example of how you can use references in variadic templates in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function template to print values using references
template <typename T>
void print(const T& value) {
    std::cout << value << std::endl;
}

// Variadic template to print multiple values using references
template <typename T, typename... Args>
void print(const T& value, const Args&... args) {
    std::cout << value << ", ";
    print(args...);
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    double b = 3.14;
    std::string c = "Hello";

    print(a, b, c);

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, the `print` function template is defined to accept a single argument and print it. The variadic template version of the `print` function accepts multiple arguments and recursively calls itself to print each argument.

By using references (`const T&`) as the function parameter type, we ensure that the objects being passed to the function are not copied but rather referenced. This is especially useful when dealing with large objects or non-copyable types.

When running the code, it will print the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` separated by commas:

```
10, 3.14, Hello
```

Using references in variadic templates allows you to pass and store objects without making unnecessary copies. However, it is important to ensure that the referenced objects have a valid lifetime when using them in variadic template functions or classes.
