In C++, references provide a way to alias an existing object. They are commonly used to pass arguments to functions by reference, allowing for efficient and safe manipulation of objects. When it comes to conditional expressions, references can be utilized in a variety of ways.

Consider the following example:

```cpp
int num = 5;
int& ref = num;

if (ref == 5) {
    // Do something
}
```

In this code snippet, we create an integer variable `num` and initialize it with the value 5. We then declare a reference variable `ref` and assign it to `num`. The conditional expression `ref == 5` evaluates whether the value referenced by `ref` is equal to 5. If true, the code block inside the if statement will be executed.

The use of references in conditional expressions can be more complex. Take a look at the following example:

```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

bool result = (a == b) ? (a = 30) : (b = 30);
```

In this code snippet, we have two integer variables `a` and `b`. The conditional expression `(a == b)` checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If true, the assignment expression `a = 30` is executed; otherwise, the assignment expression `b = 30` is executed. The result of the entire conditional expression is then stored in the `result` variable.

Remember that when working with references in conditional expressions, it's important to consider the underlying objects being referenced. Any changes made to the referenced object inside the conditional expression will be reflected outside of it as well.

To summarize, references in conditional expressions in C++ allow us to make decisions based on the values referenced by variables. By understanding how to work with references in conditional expressions, we can write more efficient and expressive code.
