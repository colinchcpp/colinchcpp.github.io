When using `std::bind`, you may come across the need to pass references as arguments. In C++, there are two ways to achieve this: using `std::ref` or using lambda functions.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use `std::bind` with references:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

void printValue(int& value) {
    std::cout << "Value: " << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int value = 42;

    auto boundFunction = std::bind(printValue, std::ref(value));
    boundFunction();  // Calls printValue with value passed as a reference

    return 0;
}
```

In the example above, we have a function `printValue` that takes an `int` reference as an argument. Inside `main`, we create a local variable `value` and initialize it with `42`.

To pass `value` as a reference to `printValue` using `std::bind`, we use `std::ref` to create a reference wrapper. The reference wrapper is then passed as an argument to `std::bind` to create a bound function object called `boundFunction`.

Finally, we call `boundFunction`, which internally calls `printValue` with `value` passed as a reference. As a result, the output of this program will be `Value: 42`.

Alternatively, you can achieve the same result using a lambda function:

```cpp
auto boundFunction = [&value]() { printValue(value); };
```

In this case, we create a lambda function that captures `value` by reference (`&value`) and calls `printValue` with `value` passed as an argument. The resulting `boundFunction` can then be invoked to achieve the same effect as before.

Using references with `std::bind` allows you to pass variables by reference and modify them within the callable object. It's a powerful feature that can be leveraged in various scenarios where you need to bind arguments to function objects.
