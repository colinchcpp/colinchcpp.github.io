When working with C++, you may come across the terms "references" and "const references." While both of them allow you to refer to a variable by another name, there are some important differences between the two. Let's dive in and explore these differences.

## References
A reference in C++ is an alias or an alternate name for an existing variable. It allows you to create synonyms for variables, making it easier to work with complex data structures or pass variables to functions without making copies.

```cpp
int x = 42;
int& ref = x;  // 'ref' is a reference to 'x'
ref++;        // Increment 'x' using the reference

std::cout << x;  // Output: 43
```

In the example above, `ref` is a reference to the variable `x`. Any changes made to `ref` will also affect `x`, as they are essentially the same variable.

## Const References
A const reference, on the other hand, is a read-only reference to a variable. It restricts modifications to the value being referred to, ensuring that it remains constant throughout its lifetime.

```cpp
int y = 10;
const int& constRef = y;  // 'constRef' is a const reference to 'y'
y++;                     // Modifying 'y' is allowed

std::cout << constRef;  // Output: 11
```

In this example, `constRef` is a const reference to `y`. Since `constRef` is a read-only reference, any attempts to modify it will result in a compilation error. However, modifying the original variable `y` is still allowed.

## Differences
The primary difference between references and const references lies in their ability to modify the value they refer to. While a reference can modify the original value, a const reference only allows reading the value and not modifying it.

Additionally, references must be initialized when they are declared, while const references can be initialized with temporary values.

To summarize their differences:
- References can modify the value they refer to, while const references cannot.
- References must be initialized when declared, while const references can be initialized with temporary values.

Understanding these differences will help you choose the appropriate way to use references or const references in your C++ code.
