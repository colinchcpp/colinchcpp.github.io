In C++, an lvalue refers to an expression that identifies a memory location and is addressable. On the other hand, an rvalue refers to an expression that represents a temporary value and does not have a memory address.

Rvalue references were introduced in C++11 to enable more efficient and safer resource management, especially in scenarios involving move semantics. They provide a way to identify and bind to rvalues, allowing for efficient move operations and eliminating the need for unnecessary copying.

To declare an rvalue reference, use the `&&` syntax:

```cpp
Type&& rvalueRef;
```

Rvalue references are typically used in conjunction with move constructors and move assignment operators to efficiently transfer ownership of resources from one object to another. 

Consider the following example:

```cpp
class Resource {
public:
    Resource() {
        // Constructor logic
    }
    
    Resource(const Resource& other) {
        // Copy constructor logic
    }
    
    Resource(Resource&& other) noexcept {
        // Move constructor logic
    }
    
    Resource& operator=(const Resource& other) {
        // Copy assignment operator logic
    }
    
    Resource& operator=(Resource&& other) noexcept {
        // Move assignment operator logic
    }
};
```

In the above example, the move constructor and move assignment operator take an rvalue reference as a parameter. This allows for efficient transfer of the resource from the source object (the rvalue) to the destination object.

By making use of rvalue references, unnecessary copying of resources can be avoided, leading to improved performance.

It is important to note that when using rvalue references, it is required to define both the move constructor and the move assignment operator explicitly. Otherwise, the compiler will generate shallow copies, defeating the purpose of using rvalue references.

Furthermore, the `noexcept` specifier in the move constructor and move assignment operator indicates that these operations do not throw exceptions. This allows for additional optimization opportunities by the compiler.

With the introduction of rvalue references in C++, developers can write more efficient code when dealing with temporary objects and resource management. By leveraging move semantics, unnecessary copies can be avoided, resulting in improved performance.
