In C++, the "&" operator is known as the "address-of" operator. It is used to retrieve the memory address of a variable. This operator is particularly useful when dealing with pointers and passing variables by reference.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of the "&" operator:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int num = 10;
  int* ptr = &num;

  cout << "Value of num: " << num << endl;
  cout << "Address of num: " << ptr << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In the code above, we declare an integer variable `num` and assign it the value of 10. Then, we declare a pointer variable `ptr` and assign it the memory address of `num`. By using the "&" operator and prefixing it to the variable name (`&num`), we obtain the memory address of `num` and store it in `ptr`.

When we print `num`, it will display the actual value stored in the variable. However, when we print `ptr`, it will display the memory address where the variable `num` is stored.

The output of the above program would be:
```
Value of num: 10
Address of num: 0x7ffee8f585a8
```

In conclusion, the "&" operator in C++ allows us to obtain the memory address of a variable, enabling us to work with pointers and pass variables by reference.
