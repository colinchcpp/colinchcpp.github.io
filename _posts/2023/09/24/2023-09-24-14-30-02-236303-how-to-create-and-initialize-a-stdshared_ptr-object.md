In C++, `std::shared_ptr` is a smart pointer that provides automatic memory management for dynamically allocated objects. It allows multiple `shared_ptr` objects to share ownership of the same object, keeping track of the number of references and automatically deallocating the memory when no more references exist.

To create and initialize a `std::shared_ptr` object, follow the steps below:

1. Include the required headers:
```cpp
#include <memory>
```

2. Define the type of object you want to manage:
```cpp
class MyClass {
    // class implementation
};
```

3. Create a new `std::shared_ptr` object using the `std::make_shared` function. This function dynamically allocates the object and initializes it, returning a `std::shared_ptr` that manages the allocated memory:
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<MyClass> ptr = std::make_shared<MyClass>();
```

4. You can also initialize the `std::shared_ptr` with a pointer to an existing object using the constructor:
```cpp
MyClass* obj = new MyClass();
std::shared_ptr<MyClass> ptr(obj);
```

It's important to note that you should avoid using raw pointers with `std::shared_ptr`. Always prefer using `std::make_shared` or the constructor of `std::shared_ptr` to ensure proper memory management.

By using `std::shared_ptr`, you don't need to explicitly deallocate the memory when you're done with the object. The `std::shared_ptr` will automatically take care of releasing the memory when the reference count reaches zero.

It is also worth mentioning that `std::shared_ptr` supports custom deleters, allowing you to define your own cleanup actions for the managed object.

By following these steps, you can create and initialize a `std::shared_ptr` object in C++. Enjoy the benefits of automatic memory management with shared ownership!
