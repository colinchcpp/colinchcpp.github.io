In C++, the `std::shared_ptr` class from the C++ Standard Library is a powerful smart pointer that provides shared ownership of dynamically allocated objects. By default, `std::shared_ptr` uses `delete` as the default deleter function to automatically free the memory when the last `std::shared_ptr` referencing the object is destroyed.

However, there are scenarios where you might want to use a custom deleter function instead of the default `delete` operator. For example, when working with resources other than dynamically allocated memory, such as file handles or network connections, you may need to release these resources in a specific way. 

Fortunately, `std::shared_ptr` provides a way to specify a custom deleter function during its initialization. The deleter function is responsible for releasing the resource held by the `std::shared_ptr` when it goes out of scope. 

Here's an example of using `std::shared_ptr` with a custom deleter function:

```cpp
void customDeleterFunction(ResourceType* resource) {
    // Custom logic to release the resource
    // e.g., closing a file, terminating a network connection, etc.
}

int main() {
    // Create a shared_ptr with a custom deleter function
    std::shared_ptr<ResourceType> sharedResource(
        new ResourceType(),  // Pointer to the resource
        customDeleterFunction // Custom deleter function
    );

    // Access the resource through the shared_ptr
    sharedResource->doSomething();
    
    // No need to manually release the resource
    // shared_ptr automatically calls the custom deleter function

    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, `ResourceType` is a user-defined type representing a resource. The `customDeleterFunction` is a user-defined function that takes a pointer to the resource and implements the logic to release the resource.

By passing the `customDeleterFunction` to the `std::shared_ptr` constructor as the second argument, we associate the custom deleter function with the `shared_ptr`. When the last `shared_ptr` referencing the resource goes out of scope, the custom deleter function will be automatically called to release the resource.

By using `std::shared_ptr` with custom deleter functions, you can ensure that resources are correctly released even in complex scenarios where multiple `shared_ptr` instances are involved. This allows for safer and more robust resource management in C++ programs.
