## Approach 1: Using stoi()

The easiest way to convert a `bitset` to an integer is to use the `std::stoi()` function, which converts a string to an integer. Since `bitset` has a built-in `to_string()` method, we can convert the `bitset` to a string and then use `stoi()` to convert it to an integer.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::bitset<8> bits("10101010");
    int result = std::stoi(bits.to_string(), nullptr, 2);
    std::cout << "Converted integer: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we create a `bitset` named `bits` with a size of 8 bits and initialize it with the binary value "10101010". We then use `bits.to_string()` to convert the `bitset` to a string. Finally, `std::stoi()` is used to convert the string to an integer by passing the base value `2` to indicate binary.

## Approach 2: Using a Loop

A more manual approach to converting a `bitset` to an integer is to use a loop and bit manipulation. We iterate through each bit of the `bitset` from the most significant bit to the least significant bit, multiplying each bit by `2` raised to the corresponding power.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main() {
    std::bitset<8> bits("10101010");
    int result = 0;
    
    for (int i = bits.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (bits[i]) {
            result += (1 << (bits.size() - 1 - i));
        }
    }
    
    std::cout << "Converted integer: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we declare a `result` variable to store the converted integer. We iterate through each bit of the `bitset` using a loop, starting from the most significant bit and going towards the least significant bit. If a bit is `1`, we calculate its value by using the bitwise left shift operator `<<` to shift `1` by the corresponding power. The shifted value is then added to the `result`. Finally, we output the `result`.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we covered two approaches to convert a C++ `bitset` to an integer. The first approach used the `std::stoi()` function to convert the `bitset` to a string and then convert the string to an integer. The second approach used a loop and bit manipulation to manually convert the `bitset` to an integer. Depending on your specific use case and performance requirements, you can choose the approach that best suits your needs.
