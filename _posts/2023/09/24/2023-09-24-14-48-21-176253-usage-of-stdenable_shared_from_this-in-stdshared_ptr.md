In C++, the `std::shared_ptr` is a smart pointer that allows multiple owners to share ownership of an object. It's commonly used to manage resources and automatically deallocate them when they're no longer needed.

Sometimes, we come across scenarios where we need to obtain a `shared_ptr` from a raw pointer within the object itself. This is where the `std::enable_shared_from_this` class template comes into play.

## What is `std::enable_shared_from_this`?

`std::enable_shared_from_this` is a base class template provided by the C++ Standard Library. It allows an object to create a `shared_ptr` that shares ownership with other `shared_ptr` instances that already exist.

## Usage Example

Let's say we have a class `MyClass` that needs to obtain a `shared_ptr` of itself. Here's how we can use `std::enable_shared_from_this` to accomplish this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class MyClass : public std::enable_shared_from_this<MyClass> {
public:
    void doSomething() {
        std::shared_ptr<MyClass> sharedPtr = shared_from_this();

        // Use sharedPtr here
    }
};

int main() {
    std::shared_ptr<MyClass> obj = std::make_shared<MyClass>();
    obj->doSomething();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `MyClass` publicly inherits from `std::enable_shared_from_this<MyClass>`, enabling it to create a `shared_ptr` using the `shared_from_this()` member function. Inside the `doSomething()` member function, we can obtain a `shared_ptr` of the current object by calling `shared_from_this()`.

It's important to note that in order to use `shared_from_this()`, the object should already have been assigned to a `shared_ptr`. In the example, we create a `shared_ptr` using `std::make_shared<MyClass>()`, which allows us to call `doSomething()` and obtain a valid `shared_ptr` of the object.

## Advantages and Considerations

Using `std::enable_shared_from_this` with `std::shared_ptr` provides the following advantages:

- Simplifies the creation of `shared_ptr` instances for objects.
- Allows objects to internally obtain `shared_ptr` instances, ensuring proper reference counting and avoiding double deletion.

However, there are some considerations to keep in mind:

- An object should only inherit from `std::enable_shared_from_this` if it's intended to be used with `shared_ptr`.
- **#C++** The inheritance should always be public. Declaring it as private or protected will result in compilation errors.

By leveraging `std::enable_shared_from_this` and `std::shared_ptr`, you can easily manage object lifetimes and safely share ownership among multiple instances in C++. #C++ #SmartPointer
