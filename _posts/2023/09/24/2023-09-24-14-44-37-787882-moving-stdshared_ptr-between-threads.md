Sharing data between threads is a common requirement in multi-threaded programming. When it comes to shared ownership of resources, `std::shared_ptr` provides a convenient solution. However, it's important to understand how to safely move `std::shared_ptr` between threads to avoid potential issues.

## The problem with moving `std::shared_ptr` directly

Directly moving `std::shared_ptr` between threads using `std::move` or any other means can result in undefined behavior. This behavior stems from the fact that `std::shared_ptr` uses an internal reference count to track ownership. If two threads attempt to modify the reference count simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions and memory corruption.

## Using `std::shared_ptr` with `std::atomic`

To safely move `std::shared_ptr` between threads, we can leverage `std::atomic`. `std::atomic` provides atomic operations for shared access to memory. By combining `std::shared_ptr` with `std::atomic`, we can ensure safe ownership transfer without risking race conditions.

```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <memory>
#include <thread>

std::atomic<std::shared_ptr<int>> globalPtr;

void threadA()
{
    std::shared_ptr<int> localPtr = std::make_shared<int>(42);
    globalPtr.store(localPtr);
}

void threadB()
{
    std::shared_ptr<int> localPtr = globalPtr.load();
    
    // Use localPtr as needed
}

int main()
{
    std::thread t1(threadA);
    std::thread t2(threadB);
    
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `threadA` creates a `std::shared_ptr<int>` and stores it in the `globalPtr` atomic variable using `std::atomic::store()`. `threadB` then loads the `std::shared_ptr<int>` from `globalPtr` using `std::atomic::load()` and can safely use it since it guarantees the reference count remains valid during the move.

## Conclusion

Moving `std::shared_ptr` between threads requires extra caution to prevent race conditions and memory corruption. By utilizing `std::atomic` to provide atomic operations, we can safely transfer ownership of `std::shared_ptr` without risking undefined behavior. Ensure to always follow safe practices when working with shared resources in multi-threaded environments.
