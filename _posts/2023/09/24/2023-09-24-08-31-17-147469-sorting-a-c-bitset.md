To start, let's assume we have a ```std::bitset``` named ```myBits``` with a size of ```N```. The first step is to convert the ```std::bitset``` to a ```std::vector<int>``` so that we can sort the individual bits. Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
std::vector<int> bitVector;
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    bitVector.push_back(myBits[i]);
}
```

Now that we have a ```std::vector<int>``` representation of the bits, we can simply use the ```std::sort``` algorithm to sort them in ascending order:

```cpp
std::sort(bitVector.begin(), bitVector.end());
```

After the sorting is complete, we can copy the sorted bits back to the original ```std::bitset```:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    myBits[i] = bitVector[i];
}
```

And that's it! You now have a sorted ```std::bitset``` in ascending order.

Here's the complete code snippet for reference:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    const int N = 8;
    std::bitset<N> myBits("10101010");
    
    std::vector<int> bitVector;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        bitVector.push_back(myBits[i]);
    }
    
    std::sort(bitVector.begin(), bitVector.end());
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        myBits[i] = bitVector[i];
    }
    
    std::cout << myBits << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In conclusion, while there is no direct method for sorting a ```std::bitset``` in C++, you can easily convert it to a ```std::vector<int>```, sort the individual bits, and then copy them back to the original ```std::bitset```. Keep in mind that this sorting method is applicable to small-size bitsets, where the overhead of the conversion and sorting process is manageable.
