1. Inability to share ownership: Unlike `std::shared_ptr`, `std::unique_ptr` cannot be shared among multiple owners. It is designed for exclusive ownership of the managed object. This means that if you need to share ownership of an object between multiple parts of your code, `std::unique_ptr` is not suitable. In such cases, you should consider using `std::shared_ptr`.

2. No support for array deletion: `std::unique_ptr` is not meant for managing arrays. While it can be used with arrays, it does not provide a default deletion mechanism for dynamically allocated arrays. This means that if you allocate an array using `new[]`, you cannot use `std::unique_ptr` to manage its memory. To manage arrays, you should use `std::unique_ptr` with a custom deleter or consider using `std::vector` instead.

To work around these limitations, you can make use of other smart pointers provided by the C++ standard library or third-party libraries. For example, if you need shared ownership, you can use `std::shared_ptr`. If you need to manage arrays, you can use `std::vector`, which provides automatic memory management for dynamically allocated arrays.

It's important to understand the limitations of `std::unique_ptr` and choose the appropriate smart pointer based on your specific requirements. By using the right smart pointer, you can ensure efficient and reliable memory management in your C++ code.
