However, there may be cases where you want to apply a mask to a `bitset`, which means selectively altering specific bits based on a pattern or condition. This can be useful when you want to clear or set certain bits in the bitset while preserving the rest.

To apply a mask to a `bitset` in C++, you can use bitwise operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `XOR` to selectively modify the bits according to your needs. Here's an example code to demonstrate how to apply a mask to a `bitset`:

```cpp
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::bitset<8> myBitset("01011011"); // Example initial bitset

    // Applying a mask to clear selected bits
    std::bitset<8> mask("11110000");
    std::cout << "Original Bitset: " << myBitset << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Mask: " << mask << std::endl;
    std::bitset<8> result = myBitset & mask;
    std::cout << "Result after applying mask: " << result << std::endl;

    // Applying a mask to set selected bits
    mask = std::bitset<8>("00001111");
    std::cout << "Original Bitset: " << myBitset << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Mask: " << mask << std::endl;
    result = myBitset | mask;
    std::cout << "Result after applying mask: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we first initialize a `bitset` named `myBitset` with a binary representation of "01011011". This is our starting bitset that we want to apply the mask to.

We then create a `bitset` named `mask` with a binary representation that represents the pattern we want to apply to the bitset. In the first example, the mask is "11110000", which will clear the first four bits of `myBitset`. In the second example, the mask is "00001111", which will set the last four bits of `myBitset`.

By performing a bitwise `AND` operation (`&`) between `myBitset` and `mask`, we clear the selected bits and store the result in `result`. Similarly, performing a bitwise `OR` operation (`|`) will set the selected bits.

Finally, we output the original bitset, the mask, and the resulting bitset after applying the mask.

By understanding how to apply a mask to a `bitset` in C++, you can easily manipulate and modify specific bits of a binary representation to suit your needs.
