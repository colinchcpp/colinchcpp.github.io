When working with binary data in C++, the `bitset` class provides a convenient way to manipulate and perform logical operations on sequences of bits. If you have multiple `bitset` objects and want to compute the logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation between them, you can follow a simple approach.

To apply logical XOR between multiple `bitset` objects in C++, you can make use of the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to perform the operation bit by bit. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main() {
    std::bitset<8> bitset1("11001010");
    std::bitset<8> bitset2("10110101");
    std::bitset<8> bitset3("01101100");

    std::bitset<8> result = bitset1 ^ bitset2 ^ bitset3;

    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In the above code, we have three `bitset` objects named `bitset1`, `bitset2`, and `bitset3`, each initialized with a sequence of 8 bits. We then apply the XOR operator between them using the `^` operator.

The result is stored in another `bitset` called `result`. Finally, we print the value of `result` to the console.

You can add more `bitset` objects and extend the bit sequence according to your requirements. The code will continue to perform the logical XOR operation between all the `bitset` objects.

Remember to include the necessary header files (`<iostream>` and `<bitset>`) to use the `bitset` class and STD input-output facilities.

By following this approach, you can easily apply the logical XOR operation between multiple `bitset` objects in C++. This technique can be handy in various scenarios involving binary operations and manipulations.
