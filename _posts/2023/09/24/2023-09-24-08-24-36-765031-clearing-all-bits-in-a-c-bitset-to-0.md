## Method 1: Using the `reset()` function

The simplest way to clear all bits in a `std::bitset` is to use the `reset()` function provided by the class. This function sets all the bits to 0.

```cpp
std::bitset<8> myBits;

// Set some bits
myBits.set(1);
myBits.set(3);
myBits.set(5);

// Clear all bits
myBits.reset();
```

In the above example, we create a `std::bitset` with a size of 8 bits. We then set bits 1, 3, and 5 to 1 using the `set()` function. Finally, we call the `reset()` function to clear all the bits, effectively setting them to 0.

## Method 2: Using the bitwise AND operator

Another way to clear all bits in a `std::bitset` is to use the bitwise AND operator (`&`). By performing a bitwise AND operation with a bitmask of all 0s, we can effectively clear all the bits in the bitset.

```cpp
std::bitset<8> myBits;

// Set some bits
myBits.set(1);
myBits.set(3);
myBits.set(5);

// Clear all bits
myBits = myBits & std::bitset<8>();

```

In this example, we create a `std::bitset` with a size of 8 bits and set bits 1, 3, and 5 to 1. Then we perform a bitwise AND operation with `std::bitset<8>()`, which is a bitmask of all 0s. This operation clears all the bits in the bitset.

## Conclusion

Clearing all bits in a `std::bitset` to 0 is a simple task when using the `reset()` function or performing a bitwise AND operation with a bitmask of all 0s. Depending on your requirements and coding style, you can choose the method that best suits your needs.
