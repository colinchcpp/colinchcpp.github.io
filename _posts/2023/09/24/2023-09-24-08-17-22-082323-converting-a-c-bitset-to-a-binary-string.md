First, let's assume we have a `Bitset` object named `bitSequence`:

```cpp
std::bitset<8> bitSequence(42);
```

In this example, `bitSequence` is a `Bitset` object with a size of 8, and its value is 42 in binary (`00101010`).

To convert this `Bitset` to a binary string, we can make use of the `to_string` function provided by the `Bitset` class:

```cpp
std::string binaryString = bitSequence.to_string();
```

The `to_string` function returns a string representation of the `Bitset` object, where each bit is converted into its corresponding character ('0' or '1'). In our example, `binaryString` would contain the value `"00101010"`.

Now, you have successfully converted the `Bitset` to a binary string.

Using this binary string, you can perform various tasks like further processing or outputting the binary representation of the `Bitset` data.
