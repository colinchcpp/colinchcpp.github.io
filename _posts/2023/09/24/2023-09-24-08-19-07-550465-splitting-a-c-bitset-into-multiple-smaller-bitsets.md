First, let's start with a basic `bitset` that we want to split. For this example, let's assume we have a `bitset` of size 32:

```cpp
std::bitset<32> originalBitset;
```

To split this `bitset` into smaller `bitsets`, we can utilize the bitwise operations `<<` and `&` to extract the desired bits into new `bitsets`. The `<<` operator is used for left-shifting, which effectively moves the bits to the left, and the `&` operator is used for bitwise AND, which allows us to extract specific bits.

Let's say we want to split our `originalBitset` into two separate `bitsets`, each containing 16 bits. We can do this by performing the following steps:

```cpp
std::bitset<16> firstHalf = originalBitset >> 16;
std::bitset<16> secondHalf = originalBitset & std::bitset<32>(0xFFFF);
```

In the first line, we use `>>` to right-shift the `bitset` by 16 positions, effectively shifting the first 16 bits out of the `bitset` and into `firstHalf`. This leaves the second half of the bits in the `bitset` as zeros.

In the second line, we use `&` to perform a bitwise AND between the `originalBitset` and a `bitset` containing the bitmask `0xFFFF` (hexadecimal value for 16 bits of all ones). This operation effectively masks out the first 16 bits, leaving us with the second half of the bits in `secondHalf`.

Now we have successfully split our `bitset` into two smaller `bitsets`. You can apply the same concept to split the `bitset` into multiple smaller `bitsets` of different sizes by adjusting the shifting and bitmasking operations accordingly.

Remember to adjust the size of the `bitset` types (`16` here) and the size of the bitmask (`0xFFFF` here) to match your specific needs.

By splitting a large `bitset` into smaller ones, you can perform operations on specific portions of the original `bitset` more efficiently, improving code readability and performance.
