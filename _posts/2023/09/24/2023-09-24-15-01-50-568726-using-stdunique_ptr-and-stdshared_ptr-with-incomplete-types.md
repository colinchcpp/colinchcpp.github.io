If you've ever encountered incomplete types in C++, you know they can be a bit challenging to handle. Incomplete types occur when you declare a pointer to a type whose definition is not available at that point. This can happen when dealing with circular references, forward declarations, or when using certain library dependencies.

Fortunately, the C++ Standard Library offers two smart pointers, `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, that can help you manage incomplete types gracefully. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use these smart pointers with incomplete types to ensure proper memory management and avoid undefined behavior.

## Using `std::unique_ptr` with Incomplete Types

`std::unique_ptr` is a unique ownership smart pointer, meaning it ensures exclusive ownership of the pointed-to object. This makes it well-suited for managing resources that should not be shared or have ownership transferred.

When dealing with incomplete types, `std::unique_ptr` can be used as a member variable or a local variable. However, you need to provide a custom deleter if the destructor of the incomplete type is not accessible. Here is an example:

```cpp
class IncompleteType;  // Forward declaration of the incomplete type

void someFunction() {
    std::unique_ptr<IncompleteType, void(*)(IncompleteType*)> ptr(nullptr, [](IncompleteType* p) { /* Custom deleter */ });

    // ...
}
```

In this example, we declare a custom deleter as a lambda function and pass it as the second template argument to `std::unique_ptr`. Inside the custom deleter, you can provide the necessary clean-up logic for the incomplete type.

## Using `std::shared_ptr` with Incomplete Types

`std::shared_ptr` is a reference-counted smart pointer that allows multiple owners of a resource. It is commonly used when you need to share ownership of an object between different parts of your code.

When working with incomplete types, using `std::shared_ptr` is a bit tricky. Since `std::shared_ptr` requires a complete type at the point of instantiation, you'll need to use a helper class and `std::weak_ptr` to indirectly manage the incomplete type. Here is an example:

```cpp
class IncompleteType;  // Forward declaration of the incomplete type

class IncompleteTypeWrapper {
public:
    std::shared_ptr<IncompleteType> ptr;
};

void someFunction() {
    std::shared_ptr<IncompleteTypeWrapper> wrapper = std::make_shared<IncompleteTypeWrapper>();
    std::shared_ptr<IncompleteType> ptr = std::weak_ptr<IncompleteType>(wrapper->ptr);

    // ...
}
```

In this example, we introduce a wrapper class, `IncompleteTypeWrapper`, to hold a `std::shared_ptr` to the incomplete type. We then create a `std::shared_ptr` to the wrapper object, and use `std::weak_ptr` to access the `IncompleteType` indirectly.

## Conclusion

Managing incomplete types in C++ can be challenging, but with the help of smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, it becomes more manageable. Whether you need exclusive ownership or shared ownership of an incomplete type, these smart pointers provide a safe and convenient way to handle memory management.

Remember to use `std::unique_ptr` with a custom deleter for exclusive ownership and `std::shared_ptr` with an indirect wrapper for shared ownership. By leveraging these smart pointers, you can avoid memory leaks and undefined behavior when working with incomplete types in C++.
