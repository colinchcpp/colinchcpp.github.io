To initialize a `std::shared_ptr` with nullptr, you can use the following syntax:

```cpp
std::shared_ptr<int> mySharedPtr = nullptr;
```

Here, we declare a `std::shared_ptr` called `mySharedPtr` and initialize it with nullptr. This creates an empty shared pointer that doesn't have ownership over any dynamically allocated object.

Initializing a `std::shared_ptr` with nullptr is useful in scenarios where you want to indicate that the pointer doesn't currently point to any valid object. It can be particularly helpful when you need to defer the initialization of a pointer until a later time.

Keep in mind that when operating on a `std::shared_ptr` initialized with nullptr, you need to ensure that the pointer has been properly assigned to a valid object before accessing or using it. Otherwise, you may encounter unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

By initializing `std::shared_ptr` with nullptr, you can clearly express the absence of a valid object and handle such situations in a safe and explicit manner.
