To begin with, let's create two `bitset` objects, `bitset1` and `bitset2`, and initialize them with some binary values:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main() {
    std::bitset<8> bitset1("01010101");
    std::bitset<8> bitset2("00110011");

    std::bitset<8> difference = bitset1 ^ bitset2;

    std::cout << "Difference between bitset1 and bitset2: " << difference << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we use the XOR operator (`^`) between `bitset1` and `bitset2` to find the difference. The XOR operator compares each bit of the two bitsets and returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.

By performing the XOR operation on `bitset1` and `bitset2`, we obtain a new `bitset` object called `difference`, which represents the difference between the two bitsets.

Finally, we print the result using `cout` to see the difference between `bitset1` and `bitset2`.

When you run the code, the output should be:

```
Difference between bitset1 and bitset2: 01100110
```

In this example, the difference between `bitset1` and `bitset2` is `01100110`.

This method of finding the difference between two `bitset` objects using the XOR operator can be applied to bitsets of any length. It provides an efficient way to compare and manipulate individual bits in C++.
