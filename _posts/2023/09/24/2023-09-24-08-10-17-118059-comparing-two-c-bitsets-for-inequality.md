The first approach is to use the `==` operator to check if two `std::bitset` objects are equal. However, if you want to compare for inequality, you can simply negate the result of the equality check using the `!` operator. Here's an example code snippet to demonstrate this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main() {
    std::bitset<8> bitset1("10101010");
    std::bitset<8> bitset2("01010101");

    bool areNotEqual = !(bitset1 == bitset2);

    if (areNotEqual) {
        std::cout << "The bitsets are not equal." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The bitsets are equal." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we define two `std::bitset` objects, `bitset1` and `bitset2`, with different binary values. We then check if they are equal using the `==` operator and negate the result to obtain the inequality check. Finally, we print the appropriate message based on the comparison result.

Another approach to compare two `std::bitset` objects for inequality is by using the `!=` operator directly. The `!=` operator returns `true` if the two bitsets are not equal, and `false` otherwise. Here's an example code snippet demonstrating this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main() {
    std::bitset<8> bitset1("10101010");
    std::bitset<8> bitset2("01010101");

    if (bitset1 != bitset2) {
        std::cout << "The bitsets are not equal." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The bitsets are equal." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we compare `bitset1` and `bitset2` directly using the `!=` operator to check for inequality. Based on the comparison result, we print the appropriate message.

Both approaches will yield the same result, but the choice between them depends on your coding style and preference. It's important to note that these comparison operators work element-wise and return the expected result for bit-by-bit comparisons.

In conclusion, comparing two `std::bitset` objects for inequality in C++ is easily accomplished using the `==` operator in conjunction with the `!` operator to negate the result. Alternatively, you can use the `!=` operator directly. Choose the approach that suits your needs and coding style.
