When working with C++, it is often important to understand the runtime type information (RTTI) of objects. RTTI allows you to determine the type of an object at runtime, which can be useful for debugging, performance optimizations, and implementing certain design patterns. In this article, we will explore several techniques for documenting and visualizing RTTI in C++.

## 1. **Using typeid Operator**

The `typeid` operator in C++ provides a way to obtain the type information of an object at runtime. It returns a `std::type_info` object that represents the type of the operand. Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <typeinfo>
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() {}
};

class Derived : public Base {};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    
    const std::type_info& type = typeid(*obj);
    std::cout << "Type: " << type.name() << std::endl;
    
    delete obj;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create a `Base` class and a `Derived` class that inherits from `Base`. We create a pointer to `Base` and instantiate it with a `Derived` object. We then use `typeid` to obtain the type information of the object and print it to the console.

## 2. **Custom Type Information**

In some cases, you may want to provide your own custom type information in addition to the default RTTI provided by the `typeid` operator. One way to achieve this is by defining a `getType` virtual function in your classes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() {}
    virtual const char* getType() const = 0;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    const char* getType() const override {
        return "Derived";
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    
    std::cout << "Type: " << obj->getType() << std::endl;
    
    delete obj;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a pure virtual function `getType` in the `Base` class that returns a `const char*` representing the type of the object. We override this function in the `Derived` class and provide a custom string representing the derived type.

## Conclusion

Understanding and visualizing the runtime type information of objects in C++ can be valuable for debugging and designing flexible systems. The techniques discussed in this article, such as using the `typeid` operator and providing custom type information, can aid in documenting and visualizing the RTTI of objects. By leveraging these techniques, you can enhance your C++ development process and make informed decisions based on the type information at runtime.
