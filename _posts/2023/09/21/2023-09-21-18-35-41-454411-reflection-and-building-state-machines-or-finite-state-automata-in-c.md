State machines, also known as finite state automata, are powerful models used in computer science and various industries to represent and analyze complex systems. They are particularly useful for modeling systems that exhibit different behaviors based on a sequence of inputs or events.

In this blog post, we will explore how to build state machines in C++ to handle different states and transitions. Let's dive in!

## Understanding State Machines

A state machine consists of a set of states, transitions between those states, and events or inputs that trigger those transitions. Each state represents a specific behavior or condition of the system, while the transitions define the flow from one state to another based on the inputs received.

## Implementing State Machines in C++

To implement state machines in C++, we can use classes to represent states and define methods for handling transitions and events. Here's an example code snippet to illustrate this:

```cpp
class StateMachine {
public:
    virtual void handleEvent(int event) = 0;
};

class State {
protected:
    StateMachine* stateMachine;

public:
    explicit State(StateMachine* sm) : stateMachine(sm) {}

    virtual void handleEvent(int event) = 0;
};

class StateA : public State {
public:
    explicit StateA(StateMachine* sm) : State(sm) {}

    void handleEvent(int event) override {
        // Handle event based on the current state
        if (event == 1) {
            // Transition to StateB
            stateMachine->setState(new StateB(stateMachine));
        }
    }
};

class StateB : public State {
public:
    explicit StateB(StateMachine* sm) : State(sm) {}

    void handleEvent(int event) override {
        // Handle event based on the current state
        if (event == 2) {
            // Transition to StateA
            stateMachine->setState(new StateA(stateMachine));
        }
    }
};

class ConcreteStateMachine : public StateMachine {
private:
    State* currentState;

public:
    ConcreteStateMachine() {
        // Initialize to a default state, e.g., StateA
        currentState = new StateA(this);
    }

    void handleEvent(int event) override {
        // Delegate the event handling to the current state
        currentState->handleEvent(event);
    }

    void setState(State* newState) {
        delete currentState;
        currentState = newState;
    }
};
```

In this example, we define an abstract `StateMachine` class that declares a method `handleEvent(int event)`. The `State` class inherits from `StateMachine` and defines its own implementation of `handleEvent()`. The `ConcreteStateMachine` class manages the current state and delegates event handling to the appropriate state.

## Conclusion

State machines provide an effective way to model systems with different states and transitions in C++. They can be used to build robust and flexible systems that respond to various inputs or events. By implementing state machines in your C++ projects, you can create more organized and manageable code that handles complex logic with ease.
