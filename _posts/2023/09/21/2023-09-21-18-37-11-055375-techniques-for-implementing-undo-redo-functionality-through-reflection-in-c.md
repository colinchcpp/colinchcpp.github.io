Implementing undo-redo functionality in an application can greatly enhance the user experience, allowing users to easily revert or redo changes made to their work. One approach to implementing this functionality is through reflection in C++. Reflection allows the program to examine and modify its own structure, including its own source code. In this blog post, we will explore some techniques for implementing undo-redo functionality through reflection in C++.

## 1. Maintaining a History Stack

The first step in implementing undo-redo functionality is to maintain a history of changes made to the application's state. This can be done by creating a stack to store the state of the application at each step. Each time a change is made, the current state is pushed onto the stack. To support undo-redo functionality, two additional stacks can be used to keep track of undone and redone states.

```cpp
std::stack<State> historyStack;
std::stack<State> undoStack;
std::stack<State> redoStack;
```
## 2. Using Reflection to Track Changes

Reflection enables us to dynamically inspect and modify objects at runtime. By leveraging reflection in C++, we can track changes made to objects and capture their state for undo-redo functionality.

```cpp
// Assume we have a class named "Object" with properties that can be changed.
class Object {
public:
    void SetPropertyA(int value) {
        // Set value and track change
        propertyA = value;
        TrackChange(this, "propertyA");
    }
    
    void SetPropertyB(float value) {
        // Set value and track change
        propertyB = value;
        TrackChange(this, "propertyB");
    }
    
    // Other methods and properties...
    
private:
    int propertyA;
    float propertyB;
    
    void TrackChange(Object* obj, const std::string& propertyName) {
        // Capture the current state of the object and push it onto the history stack
        State currentState(obj, propertyName);
        historyStack.push(currentState);
        
        // Notify the application of the change
        NotifyChange();
    }
};

class State {
public:
    State(Object* obj, const std::string& property) : object(obj), propertyName(property) {}
    
    // Getters for object and property
    
private:
    Object* object;
    std::string propertyName;
};
```

In the example above, the `TrackChange` function is called whenever a property of the `Object` class is changed. It captures the current state of the object (using a `State` object) and pushes it onto the history stack. By keeping track of the changed property name, we can later apply the changes during undo and redo operations.

## 3. Implementing Undo and Redo Operations

Once the history is maintained and changes are tracked using reflection, implementing undo and redo operations becomes relatively straightforward.

```cpp
void Undo() {
    if (!historyStack.empty()) {
        State currentState = historyStack.top();
        historyStack.pop();
        
        // Apply the state change
        ApplyState(currentState);
        
        // Push the undo state onto the undo stack
        undoStack.push(currentState);
    }
}

void Redo() {
    if (!undoStack.empty()) {
        State currentState = undoStack.top();
        undoStack.pop();
        
        // Apply the state change
        ApplyState(currentState);
        
        // Push the redo state onto the redo stack
        redoStack.push(currentState);
    }
}

void ApplyState(State& state) {
    // Apply the state change to the specified object
    Object* obj = state.GetObject();
    std::string propertyName = state.GetPropertyName();
    
    // Apply the change using reflection or other applicable techniques
    // ...
}
```

In the above example, the `Undo` and `Redo` functions are used to apply the state changes recorded in the history stack. The `ApplyState` function takes the `State` object and applies the captured changes to the corresponding object and property.

## Conclusion

By leveraging reflection in C++, we can implement undo-redo functionality in our applications. By maintaining a history stack and tracking changes using reflection, we can easily implement undo and redo operations. This improves the user experience and provides a convenient way for users to revert or redo changes made to their work.

Implementing undo-redo functionality through reflection does require careful design and consideration, especially when dealing with complex object hierarchies or handling memory management. However, with proper planning and implementation, this approach can lead to powerful and flexible undo-redo functionality in C++ applications.
