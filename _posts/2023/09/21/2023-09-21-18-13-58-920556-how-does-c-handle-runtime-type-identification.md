C++ is a statically typed language that encourages strong type safety. However, there may be scenarios where you need to identify the type of an object during runtime. For such cases, C++ provides two mechanisms: Type Traits and Run-Time Type Identification (RTTI). In this article, we will explore how C++ handles runtime type identification.

## Type Traits
Type Traits are a set of template classes that allow compile-time introspection of types. They provide information about the characteristics, properties, and operations that can be performed on a type. Type Traits are part of the `<type_traits>` header in the C++ Standard Library.

Commonly used Type Traits include:
- `std::is_same<T, U>`: Determines if `T` and `U` are the same type.
- `std::is_const<T>`: Checks if `T` is a constant type.
- `std::is_pointer<T>`: Checks if `T` is a pointer type.

By utilizing Type Traits, you can make compile-time decisions based on type information, rather than relying on runtime introspection.

## Run-Time Type Identification (RTTI)
In certain cases, compile-time type information is insufficient, and you need to determine the actual type of an object during runtime. C++ provides RTTI as a mechanism to achieve this.

RTTI allows you to:
- Determine the type of an object dynamically at runtime.
- Perform type-safe casts between base and derived classes.

To enable RTTI in a class, it must meet two requirements:
1. It must have at least one virtual function.
2. It must be `polymorphic` (have at least one virtual function).

The RTTI mechanism in C++ provides the following features:
- `dynamic_cast<TargetType>(ptr)`: It allows you to perform a runtime-checked, type-safe downcasting between polymorphic types. If the conversion is not possible, `dynamic_cast` returns a null pointer or throws an exception (if casting pointers or references respectively).
- `typeid(expression)`: It returns a reference to the `type_info` object representing the dynamic type of the expression. It's mainly used for type comparison.

Here's an example of using RTTI:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>

class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() {}
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void doSomething() {
        std::cout << "Derived class\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr = new Derived();

    if (Derived* derivedPtr = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(basePtr)) {
        derivedPtr->doSomething();
    }

    std::cout << typeid(*basePtr).name();  // Prints "Derived" since the dynamic type is Derived

    delete basePtr;
    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, we create a `Base` class and a `Derived` class that derives from `Base`. We then use `dynamic_cast` to safely downcast the `Base` pointer to a `Derived` pointer, enabling us to call the `doSomething` function. Additionally, we use `typeid` to determine the dynamic type of the object pointed to by `basePtr`.

By utilizing the power of Type Traits and RTTI, you can make your C++ code more flexible and dynamic when needed.
