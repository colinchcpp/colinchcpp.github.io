In today's financial markets, high-frequency trading (HFT) has become immensely popular. The ability to execute trades in microseconds gives traders a significant advantage. One of the strategies used in HFT is statistical arbitrage, which involves exploiting pricing discrepancies between related securities. In this article, we will explore some statistical arbitrage techniques implemented in C++ for high-frequency trading.

## 1. Pairs Trading

Pairs trading is a common statistical arbitrage strategy that involves identifying two related securities and taking long and short positions simultaneously. The idea is to take advantage of the divergence and convergence of the price ratio between the two securities. Here's a simplified code example demonstrating pairs trading in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void pairsTrading(const std::vector<double>& pricesA, const std::vector<double>& pricesB) {
    // Calculate the price ratio between securities A and B

    std::vector<double> priceRatio;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < pricesA.size(); ++i) {
        priceRatio.push_back(pricesA[i] / pricesB[i]);
    }
    
    // Identify the mean and standard deviation of the price ratio
    
    double mean = calculateMean(priceRatio);
    double standardDeviation = calculateStandardDeviation(priceRatio);
    
    // Set thresholds for entry and exit positions
    
    double entryThreshold = mean - (2 * standardDeviation);
    double exitThreshold = mean;
    
    // Perform pairs trading
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < pricesA.size(); ++i) {
        if (priceRatio[i] < entryThreshold) {
            // Go long on security A and short on security B
        }
        else if (priceRatio[i] > exitThreshold) {
            // Exit the positions
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Simulated price data for securities A and B
    
    std::vector<double> pricesA = {100.0, 101.0, 102.0, 103.0, 105.0};
    std::vector<double> pricesB = {95.0, 96.0, 98.0, 96.0, 101.0};
    
    // Execute pairs trading strategy
    
    pairsTrading(pricesA, pricesB);
    
    return 0;
}
```

## 2. Time Series Analysis

Another statistical arbitrage technique used in HFT is time series analysis. It involves studying historical price patterns and identifying potential anomalies or patterns that can be exploited for trading purposes. Common techniques used in time series analysis include moving averages, exponential smoothing, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.

Implementing time series analysis techniques requires complex mathematical calculations and algorithms. Libraries such as **Boost**, **TA-Lib**, and **GSL** provide useful tools for performing time series analysis in C++.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored two statistical arbitrage techniques, namely pairs trading and time series analysis, implemented in C++ for high-frequency trading. These strategies can help traders identify and exploit pricing discrepancies and patterns to generate profits. However, it's important to note that high-frequency trading involves significant risks, and proper risk management and backtesting should be performed before implementing such strategies.
