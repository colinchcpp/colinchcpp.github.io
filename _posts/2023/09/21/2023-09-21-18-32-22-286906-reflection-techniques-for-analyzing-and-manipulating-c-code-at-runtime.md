C++ is a powerful programming language widely used for building high-performance applications. While C++ does not have built-in reflection capabilities like some other languages, there are techniques that can be used to perform runtime analysis and manipulation of C++ code. In this article, we'll explore some of these reflection techniques and how they can be used to gain insights into program behavior and make changes at runtime.

## 1. Type Information 

Type information is essential for reflection and runtime analysis of C++ code. C++ provides the `typeid` operator, which can be used to retrieve type information at runtime. This operator returns a `type_info` object that contains information about the type, such as the type's name. Here is an example:

```cpp
#include <typeinfo>
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
  // class implementation
};

int main() {
  MyClass obj;
  std::cout << typeid(obj).name() << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use the `typeid` operator to retrieve the type information of the `obj` object and print its name. This can be useful for runtime analysis and debugging purposes.

## 2. Dynamic Casting

Dynamic casting is another technique that can be used for runtime type analysis in C++. It allows you to check if a pointer or reference to a base class can be converted to a pointer or reference to a derived class. Here is an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base {
  // base class implementation
};

class Derived : public Base {
  // derived class implementation
};

int main() {
  Base* basePtr = new Derived();
  Derived* derivedPtr = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(basePtr);

  if (derivedPtr) {
    // dynamic_cast successful
    // perform operations on the derived class
  } else {
    // dynamic_cast failed
    // basePtr is not pointing to a Derived object
  }

  delete basePtr;
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create a pointer to a `Base` object, but it is actually pointing to a `Derived` object. We use `dynamic_cast` to check if the base pointer can be safely cast to a derived pointer. If the dynamic cast is successful, we can perform operations on the derived class. Otherwise, the dynamic cast fails and we know that the base pointer is not pointing to a derived object.

## Conclusion

Although C++ does not have built-in reflection capabilities, the type information and dynamic casting techniques described above can be used to perform runtime analysis and manipulation of C++ code. These techniques can be helpful for tasks such as debugging, profiling, and implementing dynamic behaviors. Remember to use these techniques judiciously, as they can introduce complexity and potential runtime errors if not used carefully.
