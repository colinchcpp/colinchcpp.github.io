Reflection is a powerful technique that allows programs to inspect and manipulate their own structure at runtime. However, in languages like C++, reflection capabilities are limited or non-existent by default. Fortunately, there are techniques that can be employed to improve compile-time reflection capabilities in C++.

## 1. Template Metaprogramming (TMP)
Uno of the most popular techniques to achieve compile-time reflection in C++ is through Template Metaprogramming (TMP). TMP leverages the power of the C++ template system to perform computations at compile-time. By utilizing templated structures and functions, it is possible to extract type information and perform operations on them during the compilation process.

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct TypeInfo {
    static constexpr bool isPointer = std::is_pointer_v<T>;
    static constexpr bool isClass = std::is_class_v<T>;
    // Other type information...
};

template <typename T>
void Reflect(const T& obj) {
    if constexpr (TypeInfo<T>::isPointer) {
        // Handle pointer types
    } else if constexpr (TypeInfo<T>::isClass) {
        // Handle class types
    }
    // Other reflection operations...
}
```

In the above example, the `TypeInfo` struct uses compile-time type traits to extract type information such as whether the type is a pointer or a class. The `Reflect` function then utilizes these traits to perform reflection operations based on the type of the object.

## 2. Code Generation
Another approach to improving compile-time reflection capabilities in C++ is through code generation techniques. In this approach, external tools or scripts generate code based on a given set of input, such as class definitions or metadata. This generated code can then be compiled and used for reflection purposes.

One popular code generation tool for C++ is **Clang's LibTooling**. This tool can be used to parse C++ source code and generate additional code based on specified rules or patterns. The generated code can include reflection information such as type metadata, function signatures, or class hierarchies, which can be subsequently used for reflection operations.

```cpp
#include "reflection_generated.h"

int main() {
    ClassMetadata classMetadata = ReflectClass<MyClass>();
    // Perform reflection operations using the generated metadata
}
```

In the above example, a code generation tool has created a `reflection_generated.h` header file that contains the reflection metadata for the `MyClass` class. The `ReflectClass` function retrieves this metadata, enabling reflection operations on `MyClass` at compile-time.
