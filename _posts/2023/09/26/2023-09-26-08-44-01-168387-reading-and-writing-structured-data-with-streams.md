In today's tech world, working with structured data is a common task for developers. Whether it's reading data from a file or writing data to a database, efficient handling of structured data is crucial. Streams provide a powerful and efficient way to read and write structured data in various formats. Let's explore how streams can be used to handle structured data in different scenarios.

### Reading Structured Data with Streams

When reading structured data, streams allow us to parse and process data in a granular and efficient manner. One common use case is reading data from a CSV file. Let's see how we can use streams to read a CSV file and process its contents:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CSVReader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String csvFile = "data.csv";
        String line;
        
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(csvFile))) {
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
               String[] data = line.split(",");
               // Process data here...
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we use a `BufferedReader` wrapped within a try-with-resources block to read the CSV file line by line. Each line is then split into an array of *data* using the comma as a delimiter. We can then process the data as needed.

### Writing Structured Data with Streams

When it comes to writing structured data, streams provide a convenient way to write data to various output destinations. Let's consider an example where we want to write data to a JSON file:

```python
import json

data = {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
```

In this example, we use the `json.dump()` method to write the contents of the `data` dictionary to a JSON file called `data.json`. The `with` statement ensures that the file is closed properly after writing the data.

### Conclusion

Streams provide a powerful and efficient way to read and write structured data in different formats. Whether working with CSV files, JSON, XML, or other structured data formats, utilizing streams can simplify data processing tasks and improve overall performance. So next time you're working with structured data, consider leveraging streams for a more efficient and elegant solution!
