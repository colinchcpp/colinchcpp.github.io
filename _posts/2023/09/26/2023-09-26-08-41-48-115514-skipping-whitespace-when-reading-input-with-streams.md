When working with input streams, it is common to encounter scenarios where you need to skip whitespace characters. This is especially important when reading user input from the console or processing text files. In this blog post, we will explore different approaches to skipping whitespace when reading input with streams.

## Using the `Scanner` class

In Java, the `Scanner` class provides convenient methods for reading input from various sources, including the standard input stream (`System.in`) or a file. By default, the `Scanner` class automatically skips whitespace when reading data. However, you can customize this behavior by using the `useDelimiter` method.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Read an integer as input
        int number = scanner.nextInt();
        
        // Read a string as input
        String text = scanner.next();
        
        // Use the input values
        System.out.println("Number: " + number);
        System.out.println("Text: " + text);
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `nextInt` method reads an integer as input and automatically skips any preceding whitespace. Similarly, the `next` method reads a string and ignores leading whitespace.

## Using the `getline` method in C++

In C++, the `getline` function from the `<iostream>` library can be used to read input line by line and skip whitespace characters.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string line;

    // Read a line of input, skipping whitespace characters
    std::getline(std::cin >> std::ws, line);

    std::cout << "Input: " << line << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, the `std::cin >> std::ws` expression skips any leading whitespace before reading the input line. The `getline` function then reads the input line into the `line` string.

## Conclusion

Skipping whitespace when reading input with streams is a common need when working with user input or processing text files. In this blog post, we explored how to achieve this using the `Scanner` class in Java and the `getline` function in C++. By utilizing these techniques, you can easily handle and process input while ignoring any unnecessary whitespace.
