When working with input streams in programming, it is sometimes necessary to manipulate the position of the input stream pointer to read or skip specific portions of the input data. This can be particularly useful when dealing with large files or when you need to perform custom parsing.

In most programming languages, there are built-in functions or methods to manipulate the input stream pointer. Let's take a look at a few common ways to accomplish this:

## 1. Seek
The `seek` function allows you to set the position of the input stream pointer to a specific byte or character within the input stream. This function takes two parameters - the offset and the reference point.

```python
import io

# Create a BytesIO object from a byte string
input_stream = io.BytesIO(b"Hello, World!")

# Set the position of the input stream pointer to the 7th byte from the start
input_stream.seek(6, io.SEEK_SET)

# Read and print the remaining data from the input stream
print(input_stream.read())  # Output: b"World!"
```

In the example above, we create a `BytesIO` object from a byte string and then use the `seek` function to set the position of the input stream pointer to the 7th byte from the start. After seeking, we can read and print the remaining data from the input stream, which will output `b"World!"`.

## 2. Skip
Some programming languages provide a `skip` function or method that allows you to skip a certain number of bytes or characters from the input stream. This function automatically advances the position of the input stream pointer.

```java
import java.io.InputStream;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create an InputStream object
            InputStream input = new ByteArrayInputStream("Hello, World!".getBytes());

            // Skip the first 7 bytes from the input stream
            input.skip(7);

            // Read the remaining data from the input stream
            byte[] buffer = new byte[50];
            int bytesRead = input.read(buffer);

            // Convert the byte array to a string and print it
            String output = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
            System.out.println(output);  // Output: "World!"
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, we use the `skip` method of the `InputStream` class to skip the first 7 bytes from the input stream. Then we read the remaining data into a byte array, convert it to a string, and print it. The output will be `"World!"`.

By manipulating the position of the input stream pointer using the `seek` or `skip` functions, you can control which parts of the input data you want to read or skip. Understanding and using these techniques can help you efficiently process large files or perform advanced parsing operations.
