As developers, we often come across scenarios where we need to read input from a file or a user and then process it accordingly. Similarly, we may need to write formatted output to a file or display it to the user. In these situations, streams come to our rescue.

## Understanding Streams

In the context of programming, a stream is an abstraction that represents a sequence of data. Streams can be used to read data from a source or write data to a destination.

In most programming languages, streams are treated as a sequence of bytes. However, different types of streams can be used to read and write different types of data, such as characters, text, numbers, or objects.

## Reading Formatted Input with Streams

When reading input in a formatted manner, we typically have a specific structure or pattern in mind. For example, we might expect the input to consist of numbers on separate lines, or to have a specific order of values.

To read formatted input with streams, we can follow these general steps:

1. Open the input stream, specifying the source (e.g., a file or the console).
2. Read data from the stream using appropriate methods (e.g., `readLine()` or `nextInt()`).
3. Process the read data according to the desired format.
4. Close the input stream to free up resources.

Here's an example in Java that demonstrates reading formatted input from the console using the `Scanner` class:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ReadFormattedInput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter an age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        scanner.close();

        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the `nextLine()` method to read a line of input representing the name, and the `nextInt()` method to read an integer representing the age. The entered values are then processed and displayed on the console.

## Writing Formatted Output with Streams

Similar to reading formatted input, we sometimes need to write formatted output to a file or display it to the user. This is where streams also prove to be useful.

To write formatted output with streams, we can follow these general steps:

1. Open the output stream, specifying the destination (e.g., a file or the console).
2. Format the data as desired (e.g., using placeholders or formatting methods).
3. Write the formatted data to the stream using appropriate methods (e.g., `println()` or `write()`).
4. Close the output stream to ensure data is flushed and resources are released.

Let's see an example in Python that demonstrates writing formatted output to a file using the `print()` function:

```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    name = "John Doe"
    age = 25

    print(f"Name: {name}", file=file)
    print(f"Age: {age}", file=file)
```

In this example, we open a file named `output.txt` in write mode using the `open()` function with a `"w"` argument. We then use string formatting to write the name and age to the file.

## Conclusion

Streams provide a versatile and efficient way to read and write formatted input in various programming languages. By understanding how to work with streams, we can process data accurately and present it in a format that meets our requirements. This allows us to build robust and user-friendly applications that interact with different data sources efficiently.
