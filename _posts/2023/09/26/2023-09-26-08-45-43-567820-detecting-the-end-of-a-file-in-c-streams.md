To detect the end of a file in C++ streams, you can make use of the `eof()` function provided by the `std::istream` class. This function returns a boolean value of `true` if the end of the file has been reached, and `false` otherwise.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to detect the end of a file in C++ streams:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream inputFile("data.txt");

    if (inputFile.is_open()) {
        std::string line;

        // Read and process each line until the end of the file
        while (!inputFile.eof()) {
            std::getline(inputFile, line);

            // Check if end of file is reached
            if (inputFile.eof()) {
                std::cout << "End of file reached" << std::endl;
            } else {
                // Process the line
                std::cout << "Read line: " << line << std::endl;
            }
        }

        inputFile.close();
    } else {
        std::cout << "Failed to open file" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create an input file stream object named `inputFile` to read from a file called `data.txt`. Inside the `while` loop, we use `std::getline` to read each line from the file. After reading a line, we check if the end of the file has been reached using `inputFile.eof()`. If true, we print a message indicating the end of the file. Otherwise, we process the line.

Remember to include the `<iostream>` and `<fstream>` headers to use the necessary input/output stream classes.

Using the `eof()` function provides a reliable approach to detect the end of a file when working with C++ streams. However, be cautious when using it together with a loop condition since the end-of-file indicator may not be set until an attempt is made to read beyond the end of the file.
