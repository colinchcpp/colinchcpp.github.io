When working with input and output streams in C++, it is important to ensure proper synchronization between them. This synchronization ensures that the data being read from the input stream is flushed and sent to the output stream in a timely manner. In this blog post, we will explore different options to achieve synchronization in C++.

## Option 1: Using `std::endl`

One way to synchronize the input and output streams in C++ is by using the `std::endl` manipulator. When used with the output stream, such as `std::cout`, `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output buffer, ensuring that the data is immediately sent to the output stream.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Outputting data" << std::endl; // Output with synchronization
    // ...
    std::string input;
    std::cin >> input; // Synchronized input
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

In the code above, the `std::endl` manipulator is used after outputting data to `std::cout`, ensuring that the data is immediately visible on the output stream. Similarly, the input is synchronized by waiting for user input after the output.

## Option 2: Using `std::flush`

Another way to achieve synchronization between input and output streams in C++ is by using the `std::flush` manipulator. Unlike `std::endl`, `std::flush` only flushes the output buffer without inserting a newline character.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Outputting data" << std::flush; // Output with synchronization
    // ...
    std::string input;
    std::cin >> input; // Synchronized input
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

In the code above, the `std::flush` manipulator is used after outputting data to `std::cout`, ensuring that the data is immediately visible on the output stream. The input is synchronized in the same manner as in option 1.

## Conclusion

Proper synchronization between input and output streams is essential when working with C++. By using either `std::endl` or `std::flush`, you can ensure that the data is immediately visible on the output stream and that the input is synchronized accordingly.
