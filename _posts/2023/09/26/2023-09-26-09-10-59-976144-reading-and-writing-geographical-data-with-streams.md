## Reading GeoJSON data with streams

GeoJSON is a widely used format for representing geographical data, such as points, lines, and polygons. To read a GeoJSON file using streams, we can leverage the `fs` module in Node.js.

First, we need to create a readable stream using `createReadStream`. We pass the path to the GeoJSON file as an argument to this function:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const stream = fs.createReadStream('path/to/file.geojson');
```

Next, we can listen for the `data` event on the stream, which is emitted whenever new data is available. In this case, the data will be JSON objects representing geographical features:

```javascript
stream.on('data', (data) => {
  // Process the data
});
```

Inside the event handler, you can perform any desired operations on the data, such as parsing, filtering, or transforming it. For example, you can parse the JSON data using `JSON.parse`:

```javascript
stream.on('data', (data) => {
  const feature = JSON.parse(data);
  
  // Process the feature
});
```

Remember to handle any errors that may occur during stream processing by listening for the `error` event on the stream:

```javascript
stream.on('error', (error) => {
  // Handle the error
});
```

## Writing GeoJSON data with streams

To write GeoJSON data using streams, we create a writable stream using the `createWriteStream` function provided by the `fs` module:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const stream = fs.createWriteStream('path/to/output.geojson');
```

Next, we can use the stream's `write` method to write data to the file. We can pass the GeoJSON feature objects as strings to this method:

```javascript
stream.write(JSON.stringify(feature));
```

Remember to properly handle any errors that may occur during stream writing by listening for the stream's `error` event.

Once we have finished writing data, we call the `end` method to indicate that no more data will be written:

```javascript
stream.end();
```

## Conclusion

Streams provide an efficient and scalable way to read and write large amounts of geographical data. By leveraging the power of streams, we can process and handle data in a more efficient manner. Whether it's reading GeoJSON files or writing data to a file, streams can greatly improve the performance and flexibility of your geographical data processing applications.
