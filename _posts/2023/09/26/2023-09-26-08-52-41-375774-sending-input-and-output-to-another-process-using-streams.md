In certain scenarios, you may need to communicate with another process by sending input and receiving output. This can be achieved using streams in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C#.

Streams provide a way to read data from a source or write data to a destination. By utilizing streams, you can easily communicate with another process and exchange data. Let's explore how we can send input to another process and receive output using streams in Java as an example.

## Sending Input to Another Process

To send input to another process in Java, you can make use of the `Process` class from the `java.lang` package. Here is an example that demonstrates the process:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ProcessInputDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("your_command_here");

            OutputStream outputStream = process.getOutputStream();
            outputStream.write("input_data_here".getBytes());
            outputStream.flush();
            outputStream.close();

            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(process.getInputStream());
            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
                System.out.println(scanner.nextLine());
            }
            scanner.close();

            int exitCode = process.waitFor();
            System.out.println("Process exited with code: " + exitCode);
        } catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method is used to execute the command or process you want to communicate with. The `getOutputStream()` method allows you to obtain the output stream of the process. You can then write the input data to the output stream using the `write()` method. Finally, `flush()` is called to ensure all the data is sent, and `close()` is used to indicate that no further data will be written.

## Receiving Output from Another Process

To receive output from another process, you can read the input stream of the `Process` class. Here is an example that demonstrates this process using Java:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ProcessOutputDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("your_command_here");

            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(process.getInputStream());
            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
                System.out.println(scanner.nextLine());
            }
            scanner.close();

            int exitCode = process.waitFor();
            System.out.println("Process exited with code: " + exitCode);
        } catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, after executing the desired command using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`, the `getInputStream()` method is used to obtain the input stream of the process. The `Scanner` class is then utilized to read the output line by line using the `nextLine()` method.

## Conclusion

Sending input and receiving output from another process using streams is a convenient way to communicate and exchange data between processes. Whether you're working with Java, Python, or any other programming language that supports streams, you can utilize similar concepts to achieve this functionality. By understanding and implementing these techniques, you can enhance the inter-process communication in your projects.
