## What are breakpoints?

Breakpoints are markers that you set in your code to pause program execution at a specific line. When the program reaches a breakpoint, it will halt, giving you the chance to examine the state of variables, analyze the program flow, and identify any bugs or logical errors.

## Setting breakpoints in C++

To set a breakpoint in C++, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio, CLion, or Eclipse, which provide user-friendly interfaces for setting breakpoints. Alternatively, you can use a debugger like GDB or LLDB from the command line.

To set a breakpoint in an IDE, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in the IDE of your choice.
2. Navigate to the line of code where you want to set the breakpoint.
3. Click on the line number or use the keyboard shortcut provided by the IDE (usually F9).
4. A red circle or marker will appear on the line, indicating that a breakpoint has been set.

If you are using a debugger from the command line, you can set breakpoints using commands specific to the debugger. For example, in GDB, you can set a breakpoint at a particular line by typing:

```cpp
break <line_number>
```

## Debugging with breakpoints

Once you have set breakpoints in your code, it's time to debug. Start your program in debug mode, either by clicking the IDE's debug button or executing the debug command in the command line debugger.

When the program hits a breakpoint, it will pause execution, and you will be able to inspect the program's state. Most IDEs provide a Debug tab or window where you can see variables, their values, and the call stack.

From here, you can perform several actions to debug your code:

- **Step Over**: Execute the current line and move to the next line. If the current line contains a function call, the entire function is executed, and control is returned to the next line.
- **Step Into**: If the current line contains a function call, step into the function and continue debugging inside the called function.
- **Step Out**: If you are inside a function, step out of the current function and return control to the calling function.
- **Inspect Variables**: Examine the values of variables to understand how they change during execution.
- **Modify Variables**: Change the value of variables to test different scenarios and observe their effects on the program.

By utilizing breakpoints and debugging features, you can efficiently identify and fix bugs in your C++ code, making the development process smoother and more efficient.
