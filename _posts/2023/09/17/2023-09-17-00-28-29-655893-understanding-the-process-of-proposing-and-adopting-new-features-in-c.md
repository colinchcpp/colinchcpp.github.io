C++ is a powerful and widely-used programming language that is constantly evolving to meet the needs of modern software development. If you're a C++ developer, it is important to understand how new features are proposed and adopted in the language. In this blog post, we will delve into the process of proposing and adopting new features in C++.

## The Evolution Working Group

The C++ Standardization Committee (also known as WG21) is responsible for managing the evolution of the C++ programming language. Within this committee, there is a dedicated team called the Evolution Working Group (EWG) that focuses on proposing and reviewing new language features.

The EWG consists of C++ experts and enthusiasts who collaborate to improve the language by proposing, discussing, and reviewing new ideas. *Contributors submit proposals in the form of documents, explaining the problem they aim to solve, the proposed solution, and examples showcasing the syntax and usage*.

## The Proposal Review Process

Once a proposal is submitted, it goes through a rigorous review process to ensure that the proposed feature aligns with the goals and principles of C++ and doesn't introduce any negative consequences. The review process typically consists of the following stages:

1. **Preparation**: The proposal author prepares the proposal document, addressing the problem, solution, and potential impact on the language and existing code.

2. **Initial Review**: The proposal is reviewed by the EWG members, who provide feedback, ask questions, and suggest improvements. This stage aims to catch any major issues early on.

3. **Revision**: Based on the feedback received during the initial review, the proposal author revises the document, making necessary changes and addressing concerns raised by the reviewers.

4. **Final Review**: The revised proposal document is presented to the EWG for a final round of review. This is where the proposal is scrutinized in detail, and any potential pitfalls or compatibility issues are thoroughly examined.

5. **Consensus**: The proposal must achieve a consensus within the EWG for it to move forward. If there are unresolved disagreements, further discussions and revisions may be required.

6. **Standardization**: If a proposal gains consensus within the EWG, it moves to the next stage, where it undergoes a more formal review process as part of the C++ Standardization process. The proposal is discussed and refined further, and ultimately, it may be included in the official C++ Standard.

## Contributing to C++ Evolution

If you're passionate about C++ and want to contribute to the language's evolution, you can get involved in the process of proposing and adopting new features. Here are a few ways to actively contribute:

- **Stay informed**: Follow the discussions and proposals on the C++ Standardization Committee's mailing lists and attend C++ conferences to stay up-to-date with the latest developments.

- **Submit proposals**: If you have a new feature or improvement idea, prepare a proposal document and submit it to the EWG for review. Be sure to present your case clearly, providing solid reasoning and examples.

- **Participate in discussions**: Engage in discussions on the mailing lists and forums to share your insights, ask questions, and provide constructive feedback on existing proposals.

- **Review and provide feedback**: Participate in the review process by providing feedback on proposals. Your perspective and insights can help shape the future of C++.

## Conclusion

Understanding the process of proposing and adopting new features in C++ is crucial for any C++ developer who wants to stay up-to-date with the latest language advancements. By actively participating in the evolution of C++, you can contribute to the language's growth and help shape its future. So, stay informed, engage in discussions, and submit your ideas to ensure that C++ continues to meet the needs of the ever-changing software development landscape.
