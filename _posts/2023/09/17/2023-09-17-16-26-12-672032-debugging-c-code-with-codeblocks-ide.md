## Setting up the Debug Environment
Before we dive into debugging, make sure you have Code::Blocks installed on your system. Once you have it installed, follow these steps to set up the debug environment:

1. Open your project in Code::Blocks.
2. Go to the "Project" menu and select "Properties."
3. In the properties dialog, select the "Build targets" tab.
4. Select the target you want to debug (usually the default one) and click the "Set as active" button.
5. Next, select the "Build options" tab and enable the "Produce debugging symbols" option.
6. Click "OK" to save the changes.

Now that your debug environment is set up, let's explore some of the debugging features offered by Code::Blocks.

## Setting Breakpoints
Breakpoints allow you to pause the execution of your code at specific lines to investigate the program's state. To set a breakpoint in Code::Blocks, follow these steps:

1. Open the source file you want to debug.
2. Navigate to the line where you want to pause the execution.
3. Click in the margin area next to the line number. A red dot should appear, indicating a breakpoint has been set.

## Starting the Debugging Session
To start debugging your code in Code::Blocks, you can either click the green "Play" button in the toolbar or go to the "Debug" menu and select "Start/Continue." This will launch your executable with the debugger attached.

## Debugging Tools
Once your code is running in debug mode, you have access to several powerful debugging tools in Code::Blocks. Here are a few commonly used ones:

### Step Over (F8)
This feature allows you to execute the current line of code and move to the next line. If the current line contains a function call, it will execute the entire function without pausing.

### Step Into (F7)
Use the "Step Into" command to move to the next line of code. If the line contains a function call, the debugger will pause inside the called function.

### Step Out (Shift+F8)
If you're currently inside a function and want to finish executing it without going through every line, use the "Step Out" command. This will take you back to the calling function.

### Watch Window
The watch window allows you to monitor the value of specific variables during runtime. You can add variables to the watch window by right-clicking on them and selecting "Add Watch."

These are just a few of the many debugging features offered by Code::Blocks. By utilizing these tools effectively, you can significantly speed up the debugging process and find and fix bugs more efficiently.

Happy debugging!
