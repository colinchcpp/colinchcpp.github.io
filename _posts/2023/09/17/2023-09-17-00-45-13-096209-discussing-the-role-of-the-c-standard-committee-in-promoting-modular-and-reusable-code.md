The C++ Standard Committee is a group of industry experts and language enthusiasts who work together to define and evolve the C++ programming language standard. They are responsible for introducing new features, improving existing ones, and ensuring a high level of quality and reliability in the language.

In recent years, the committee has been actively working on introducing features and guidelines that promote modularity and code reuse. Two important initiatives in this regard are the Concepts and Modules proposals.

Concepts, added to C++20, are a powerful tool for expressing type constraints and requirements. By using concepts, developers can more effectively communicate and enforce expectations about template parameters. This leads to more modular code that is easier to understand and reuse. Additionally, concepts enable better error messages, as they provide clearer feedback when a constraint is not satisfied.

Modules, introduced in C++20 as an experimental feature, aim to solve the long-standing issue of separate compilation and reduce the impact of header file dependencies. With modules, developers can organize code into independent units that can be compiled individually and combined at link time. This not only improves compile times but also simplifies the process of managing dependencies and avoids common pitfalls associated with header files, such as include guards and macro conflicts.

Both concepts and modules provide tools that enable developers to write more modular and reusable code in C++. By expressing requirements and organizing code into independent units, it becomes easier to reason about, maintain, and extend large-scale C++ projects.

In conclusion, the C++ Standard Committee plays a crucial role in promoting modularity and code reuse within the C++ community. Through initiatives like Concepts and Modules, they are continuously working to improve the language and provide developers with the tools they need to write efficient, maintainable, and reusable code.
