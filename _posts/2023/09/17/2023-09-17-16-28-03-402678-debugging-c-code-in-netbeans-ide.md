When it comes to debugging C++ code in NetBeans IDE, the process is straightforward and can be done in a few simple steps. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to debug your C++ code in NetBeans IDE.

**Step 1: Set a Breakpoint**
A breakpoint is a line of code where you want the debugger to pause the execution of your program. To set a breakpoint, simply click on the left margin of the line number where you want to stop the execution. A red dot will appear indicating the breakpoint is set.

**Step 2: Start the Debugger**
To start the debugger, go to the "Debug" menu at the top of the NetBeans IDE interface and click on "Debug Project" or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + F5`. This will compile and run your program in debug mode.

**Step 3: Debugging Tools**
Once your program is running in debug mode, the Debugging window will appear at the bottom of the NetBeans IDE screen. This window provides various tools and options for debugging your code. Here's a quick overview of some important debugging tools:

* **Step Into (F7):** This option allows you to step into a function call line by line. If you encounter a function call, you can use this option to directly enter the function and debug it.

* **Step Over (F8):** This option allows you to execute the current line and move to the next line. If you encounter a function call, this option will execute the entire function without stepping into it.

* **Step Out (Shift + F8):** This option allows you to step out of the current function and return to the calling function.

* **Resume (F5):** This option resumes the program execution from the current breakpoint and continues until the next breakpoint or program completion.

* **Variables window:** The Variables window displays the values of variables in the current scope. You can view and modify these values during debugging.

**Step 4: Inspecting Variables**
During debugging, you can inspect the values of variables at different points in your code. The Variables window, as mentioned earlier, provides a list of variables along with their current values. You can also add variables to the Watchlist for easier access and monitoring.

**Step 5: Debugging Errors**
When an error occurs while debugging, NetBeans IDE will automatically pause the execution at the relevant line where the error occurred. You can examine the error message and the current state of your program's variables to identify the cause of the error.

**Step 6: Finish Debugging**
Once you have identified and fixed the issue, you can continue running your program without debugging. To do this, go to the "Debug" menu and click on "Finish Debugger Session" or use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + F5`. This will stop the debugging session and allow your program to run normally.

In conclusion, NetBeans IDE provides a powerful and easy-to-use debugging environment for C++ code. By following these simple steps, you can effectively debug your C++ programs and identify and fix errors efficiently. Happy debugging!
