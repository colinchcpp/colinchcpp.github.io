The C++ programming language has evolved over the years, thanks to the efforts of the C++ Standard Committee. The committee, comprised of language experts and industry professionals, works to refine the C++ language specification, introducing new features and addressing existing issues. These updates have a significant impact on how developers write C++ code and the programming paradigms they employ.

## Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a widely-used paradigm in C++, which emphasizes the concept of objects and their interactions. The C++ Standard Committee has made significant contributions to enhancing OOP in C++ through various language features.

One notable addition is the introduction of `class` templates, allowing developers to define reusable generic data structures and algorithms. This feature promotes code reuse and abstraction, two important principles of OOP.

Another enhancement is the addition of `constexpr`, enabling the definition of compile-time constants and functions. With this feature, developers can create more flexible and efficient code, in line with OOP principles.

## Functional Programming Paradigm

Functional programming (FP) is gaining popularity in modern software development due to its focus on immutability, pure functions, and higher-order operations. The C++ Standard Committee has recognized the importance of FP and introduced several features to support this programming paradigm.

The addition of lambdas brings anonymous function support to C++, allowing developers to write more concise and functional-style code. Lambdas enable the use of higher-order functions, such as `std::transform` and `std::accumulate`, making it easier to perform operations on collections.

The introduction of `std::function` provides a way to store and invoke callable objects. This feature facilitates the implementation of functional concepts like function composition and currying.

In conclusion, the work of the C++ Standard Committee has had a significant impact on the usage of specific programming paradigms in C++. It has enriched the object-oriented programming paradigm with features like `class` templates and `constexpr`. Additionally, it has embraced the functional programming paradigm by introducing lambdas and `std::function`. These advancements empower developers to write more expressive, reusable, and efficient code in accordance with their preferred programming style.
