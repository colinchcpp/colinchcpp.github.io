1. **Print Statements:** One of the simplest and most effective ways to debug your code is by adding print statements at various points in your program. Printing the values of variables and intermediate results can help you understand the flow of execution and identify any unexpected values or behaviors.

Example:

```cpp
int main() {
    int num1 = 5;
    int num2 = 10;
    
    std::cout << "Value of num1: " << num1 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value of num2: " << num2 << std::endl;
    
    int sum = num1 + num2;
    std::cout << "Sum of num1 and num2: " << sum << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

2. **Breakpoints:** Most modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide support for setting breakpoints in your code. By placing breakpoints at specific lines, you can pause the program's execution and inspect the values of variables, step through the code line by line, and gain insight into its behavior. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with complex logic or loops.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num1 = 5;
    int num2 = 10;
    
    int sum = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < num2; i++) {
        sum += num1;
    }
    
    std::cout << "Sum of num1 and num2: " << sum << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

By setting a breakpoint inside the `for` loop, you can observe the value of `sum` at each iteration and catch any logic errors.

3. **Runtime checks:** C++ offers various runtime checks that can help you detect and handle issues during program execution. For example, assertions (`assert()`) allow you to test for specific conditions and halt the program if they are not met. This can be helpful in catching unexpected states or input errors.

```cpp
#include <cassert>

void divide(int num1, int num2) {
    assert(num2 != 0); // Ensure num2 is not zero
    
    int result = num1 / num2;
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 0;
    
    divide(num1, num2);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `assert` statement ensures that `num2` is not zero before performing the division. If the condition is false, the program will terminate and display an error message.

4. **Debugger:** Utilizing a debugger is a powerful way to debug C++ programs. Debuggers allow you to step through your code, set breakpoints, examine variable values, and analyze the program's control flow. They provide an interactive environment to pinpoint and resolve issues more effectively.

These are just a few of the common debugging techniques you can use in C++. Remember, debugging is an iterative and methodical process. By combining these techniques with your problem-solving skills, you can effectively squash bugs and ensure the smooth running of your C++ programs. #C++ #Debugging
