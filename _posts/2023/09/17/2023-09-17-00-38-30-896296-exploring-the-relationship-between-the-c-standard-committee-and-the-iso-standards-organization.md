## Introduction
The C++ programming language, known for its efficiency and performance, has been around for several decades. To ensure the language remains relevant and up to date with industry needs, the C++ Standard Committee (also known as the ISO C++ Committee) was formed. In this blog post, we'll explore the relationship between the C++ Standard Committee and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), shedding light on their collaboration and how it impacts the C++ language.

## ISO and the C++ Standard Committee
The ISO is an international standards organization responsible for developing and publishing various standards across a wide range of industries. The C++ programming language is not an exception - it too has an ISO standard that governs its functionalities and features. The ISO/IEC 14882 standard, commonly known as the C++ Standard, is maintained and updated by the C++ Standard Committee.

## The Role of the C++ Standard Committee
The C++ Standard Committee is a group of representatives from different organizations, including compiler vendors, academia, and individual experts. They collaborate to propose and discuss changes and additions to the C++ language. These proposals are known as Technical Specifications (TS) and go through a rigorous review process.

The committee members actively contribute by discussing, voting, and providing technical expertise on various proposals. They review proposed language features, library improvements, and bug fixes with the aim of enhancing the language's capabilities.

## Collaboration and Standardization Process
The C++ Standard Committee follows a defined process to ensure transparency, quality, and consensus in the standardization process. The process involves multiple stages, including:
1. Proposal submission: Individuals or organizations can submit proposals for language or library enhancements.
2. Review and study group formation: Proposals are reviewed by designated study groups within the committee. These groups evaluate the technical merits, feasibility, and impact of proposed changes.
3. Technical Specifications (TS) development: Once a proposal gains traction, it goes through an iterative refinement process to develop a Technical Specification document. The document describes the proposed feature and its behavior.
4. Consensus and voting: After thorough discussion and refinement, the committee votes to accept or reject the proposed Technical Specification.
5. ISO standardization: Accepted Technical Specifications are incorporated into the ISO/IEC 14882 standard. This process ensures that the resulting standard is well-defined, thoroughly reviewed, and representative of the consensus reached by the committee.

## Impact on the C++ Language
The collaborative effort between the C++ Standard Committee and the ISO helps shape the evolution of the C++ language and its standard libraries. By incorporating community input and industry needs, the committee ensures that the language remains modern and capable of addressing new challenges.

The standardized C++ language brings several benefits to developers, including portability, predictability, and stability. Having a well-established standard ensures that code written in C++ is compatible across different compilers and platforms. It also provides a stable base for tooling, libraries, and frameworks to build upon.

## Conclusion
The relationship between the C++ Standard Committee and the ISO standards organization is crucial for maintaining the relevance and evolution of the C++ programming language. Through collaborative discussions, proposals, and a standardized process, the committee ensures that the C++ language and its standard libraries meet the needs of the industry. This commitment to continuous improvement empowers developers to write efficient, modern, and portable code in C++.
