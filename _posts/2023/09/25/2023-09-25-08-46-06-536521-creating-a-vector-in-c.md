To create a vector in C++, you need to include the `<vector>` library.

```cpp
#include <vector>
```

Once the library is included, you can declare a vector by specifying its type.

```cpp
std::vector<int> myVector; // Creates an empty vector of integers
```

This creates an empty vector of integers named `myVector`. You can also initialize the vector with initial values using initialization lists.

```cpp
std::vector<int> myInitializedVector = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initializes a vector with values
```

To add elements to the vector, you can use the `push_back()` method.

```cpp
myVector.push_back(10); // Adds the element 10 to the end of the vector
```

You can access elements of the vector using the subscript operator `[]`.

```cpp
int firstElement = myVector[0]; // Retrieves the value at index 0
```

The `size()` function returns the current size of the vector.

```cpp
int vectorSize = myVector.size(); // Returns the number of elements in the vector
```

To iterate over the vector and perform operations on each element, you can use a for loop.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < myVector.size(); i++) {
    std::cout << myVector[i] << " "; // Prints each element followed by a space
}
```

Remember to include the `<iostream>` library to use the `std::cout` object for printing.

Vectors in C++ are versatile and provide many other useful functions like `pop_back()`, `insert()`, `erase()`, and more. It is a powerful tool for dynamically managing collections of elements.

So, if you need to work with a dynamically resizable array in C++, a vector is a great choice to simplify your coding process and make your program more flexible and efficient.
