Python:
```python
my_vector = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
vector_size = len(my_vector)
print(f"The size of the vector is {vector_size}")
```
In Python, the `len()` function can be used to get the size of a vector. The function takes the vector as its argument and returns the number of elements in the vector. The result can then be assigned to a variable or directly printed.

C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> my_vector {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int vector_size = my_vector.size();
    std::cout << "The size of the vector is " << vector_size << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In C++, the `size()` function is a member function of the `std::vector` class. It returns the number of elements in the vector. The result can be assigned to a variable and printed using the standard output stream.

Java:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class VectorSizeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> myVector = new ArrayList<>();
        myVector.add(1);
        myVector.add(2);
        myVector.add(3);
        myVector.add(4);
        myVector.add(5);
        
        int vectorSize = myVector.size();
        System.out.println("The size of the vector is " + vectorSize);
    }
}
```
In Java, the `size()` method is also a member method of the `ArrayList` class. It returns the number of elements in the list. The size can be assigned to a variable and printed using the `System.out.println()` statement.

Checking the size of a vector is a fundamental operation when working with arrays and lists. By using the appropriate function in your programming language, you can easily determine the size or length of a vector and perform subsequent operations accordingly.
