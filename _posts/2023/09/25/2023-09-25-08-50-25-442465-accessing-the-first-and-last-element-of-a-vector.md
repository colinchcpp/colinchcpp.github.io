When working with vectors in programming, sometimes we need to access the first and last elements of the vector. In this article, we will explore how to do this in different programming languages.

## Python

In Python, you can easily access the first and last elements of a list using indexing. Here's an example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

first_element = my_list[0]
last_element = my_list[-1]

print("First element:", first_element)
print("Last element:", last_element)
```

Output:

```
First element: 1
Last element: 5
```

In the example above, the `my_list` variable is a list containing elements 1 to 5. By indexing with `0`, we access the first element, while using `-1` allows us to access the last element.

## Java

In Java, the first and last elements of an array or ArrayList can be obtained using indexing. Here's an example using an array:

```java
int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

int firstElement = myArray[0];
int lastElement = myArray[myArray.length - 1];

System.out.println("First element: " + firstElement);
System.out.println("Last element: " + lastElement);
```

Output:

```
First element: 1
Last element: 5
```

In the Java example above, we have an array called `myArray` containing elements 1 to 5. By accessing `myArray[0]`, we get the first element, and `myArray[myArray.length - 1]` gives us the last element.

## JavaScript

In JavaScript, we can access the first and last elements of an array using indexing as well. Here's an example:

```javascript
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const firstElement = myArray[0];
const lastElement = myArray[myArray.length - 1];

console.log("First element:", firstElement);
console.log("Last element:", lastElement);
```

Output:

```
First element: 1
Last element: 5
```

In this JavaScript example, we declare an array called `myArray` with elements 1 to 5. Accessing `myArray[0]` gives us the first element, while `myArray[myArray.length - 1]` provides the last element.

## Conclusion

Knowing how to access the first and last elements of a vector is essential when working with lists or arrays in different programming languages. By utilizing simple indexing techniques, it becomes easy to retrieve these important elements for further manipulation or analysis.
