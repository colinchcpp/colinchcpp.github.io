## Splitting Strings in Python
Python provides a built-in method called `split()` for strings, which can be used to split a string into a list of substrings. By default, it splits the string at whitespace characters. Here's an example:

```python
string = "Hello, World!"
result = string.split()
print(result)
```
Output:
```
['Hello,', 'World!']
```
In this case, the `split()` method splits the string `string` into substrings based on the space character and returns a list `['Hello,', 'World!']`.

If you want to split the string based on a different delimiter, you can pass it as an argument to the `split()` function. For example, to split a string at commas, you can do:

```python
string = "Apple, Banana, Orange"
result = string.split(", ")
print(result)
```

Output:
```
['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange']
```

## Splitting Strings in JavaScript
In JavaScript, you can use the `split()` method on a string to split it into an array of substrings. Here's an example:

```javascript
const string = "Hello, World!";
const result = string.split(" ");
console.log(result);
```

Output:
```
['Hello,', 'World!']
```

By default, the `split()` method splits the string at whitespace characters. You can specify a different delimiter by passing it as an argument to the `split()` method.

```javascript
const string = "Apple, Banana, Orange";
const result = string.split(", ");
console.log(result);
```

Output:
```
['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange']
```

## Summary
Splitting a string into a vector of substrings is a handy operation in many programming languages. Python provides the `split()` method, while JavaScript has the `split()` function. By specifying a delimiter, you can split a string into smaller components and store them in a vector, array, or list. This functionality is helpful when dealing with text processing tasks, such as parsing CSV files or tokenizing sentences.
