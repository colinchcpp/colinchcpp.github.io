Linear algebra plays a crucial role in many areas of technology, including machine learning, computer graphics, and physics simulations. Vectors are fundamental elements in linear algebra, and performing operations on vectors is a key skill to master. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement common linear algebra operations with vectors.

## 1. Vector Addition

Vector addition is the process of adding two vectors together. It involves adding the corresponding components of the vectors to form a new vector. Let's take a look at the implementation in Python:

```python
def vector_addition(vec1, vec2):
    """Adds two vectors together"""
    result = []
    for i in range(len(vec1)):
        result.append(vec1[i] + vec2[i])
    return result
```

You can then use this function to add two vectors:

```python
vector1 = [1, 2, 3]
vector2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = vector_addition(vector1, vector2)
print(result)  # Output: [5, 7, 9]
```

## 2. Vector Subtraction

Vector subtraction is similar to vector addition, but instead of adding the components, we subtract them. Here's how you can implement it:

```python
def vector_subtraction(vec1, vec2):
    """Subtracts one vector from another"""
    result = []
    for i in range(len(vec1)):
        result.append(vec1[i] - vec2[i])
    return result
```

Let's try subtracting two vectors:

```python
vector1 = [5, 7, 9]
vector2 = [1, 2, 3]
result = vector_subtraction(vector1, vector2)
print(result)  # Output: [4, 5, 6]
```

## 3. Dot Product

The dot product of two vectors is a scalar quantity equal to the sum of the products of their corresponding components. It is a fundamental operation in linear algebra. Here's an implementation in Python:

```python
def dot_product(vec1, vec2):
    """Calculates the dot product of two vectors"""
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(vec1)):
        result += vec1[i] * vec2[i]
    return result
```

To calculate the dot product of two vectors:

```python
vector1 = [1, 2, 3]
vector2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = dot_product(vector1, vector2)
print(result)  # Output: 32
```

## Conclusion

Understanding and implementing these basic linear algebra operations with vectors is essential for various applications in technology. We covered vector addition, vector subtraction, and the dot product. These operations serve as building blocks for more complex mathematical computations. 

By building a solid foundation in linear algebra, you will be well-equipped to handle more advanced concepts and algorithms used in fields like machine learning and computer graphics. So, keep practicing and exploring the world of linear algebra!
