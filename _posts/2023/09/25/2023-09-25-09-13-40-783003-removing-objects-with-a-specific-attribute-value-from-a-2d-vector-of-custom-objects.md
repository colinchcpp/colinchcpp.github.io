## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to remove objects from a 2D vector of custom objects based on a specific attribute value using C++. This can be useful when working with complex data structures and needing to filter out certain objects that meet certain criteria. By leveraging the power of the Standard Template Library (STL) and some simple algorithms, we can easily achieve this task efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have a basic understanding of the following concepts:

- C++ programming language
- Working with vectors and custom objects in C++
- Basic algorithms and data structures

## Problem Statement

We have a 2D vector `data` of custom objects, where each object has several attributes. We want to remove all the objects from `data` that have a specific attribute value matching a given parameter `value`. 

## Solution

Let's see how we can implement a solution to this problem using C++:

```cpp
// Define the custom object structure
struct CustomObject {
    int id;
    std::string name;

    // Additional attributes and methods
};

// Function to remove objects with specific attribute value from a 2D vector
void removeObjectsWithValue(std::vector<std::vector<CustomObject>>& data, int value) {
    for(auto& row : data) {
        row.erase(std::remove_if(row.begin(), row.end(), [value](const CustomObject& obj){
            return obj.id == value;
        }), row.end());
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample 2D vector of custom objects
    std::vector<std::vector<CustomObject>> data = {
        {{1, "Object1"}, {2, "Object2"}},
        {{3, "Object3"}, {4, "Object4"}, {5, "Object5"}},
        {{6, "Object6"}}
    };

    // Remove objects with attribute value 2
    removeObjectsWithValue(data, 2);

    // Print the updated data
    for(const auto& row : data) {
        for(const auto& obj : row) {
            std::cout << "ID: " << obj.id << ", Name: " << obj.name << std::endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a `CustomObject` structure representing our custom object with `id` and `name` attributes. We then define the `removeObjectsWithValue` function that takes the 2D vector `data` and the `value` parameter. 

Inside the function, we iterate over each row of the 2D vector using a range-based for loop. For each row, we use the `std::remove_if` algorithm along with a lambda function to remove objects with the specified attribute value `value`. Finally, we use the `erase` function to remove the objects from the row.

In the `main` function, we create a sample 2D vector `data`. We then call the `removeObjectsWithValue` function with the value `2`. After removal, we print the updated data to verify that the objects with attribute value `2` have been successfully removed.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to remove objects with a specific attribute value from a 2D vector of custom objects using C++. By utilizing the functionalities provided by the STL and some simple algorithms, we can effectively filter out objects that meet certain criteria. This approach can be extended to other scenarios where you need to remove objects based on different attributes or conditions.
