Introduction:
C++ coroutines provide a powerful mechanism for writing asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable way. To fully utilize coroutines in C++, understanding the syntax and keywords associated with them is essential. In this blog post, we will delve into the core concepts of C++ coroutines and discuss the syntax and keywords used in implementing them.

Keywords and Syntax:

1. `co_await`:
The `co_await` keyword is used within a coroutine to suspend its execution until a given operation completes. This operation could be an asynchronous task or a coroutine itself. This keyword allows other parts of the program to continue executing until the awaited operation is finished.

Example usage:
```cpp
std::future<int> fetchDataAsync() {
    // Simulating asynchronous task using std::async
    return std::async(std::launch::async, [] {
        // Fetch data asynchronously
        // ...
        return 42; // Return a value when data fetching completes
    });
}

std::future<void> performTaskAsync() {
    int data = co_await fetchDataAsync();
    // Perform task using the fetched data asynchronously
    // ...
    co_return; // Return void when the task completes
}
```

2. `co_return`:
The `co_return` keyword is used to resume and complete the execution of a coroutine. It is followed by an optional expression that represents the result or return value of the coroutine.

Example usage:
```cpp
std::string performTask() {
    // Simulating coroutine using generator
    co_yield "Executing first part of the task";
    // ...

    co_yield "Executing second part of the task";
    // ...

    co_return "Task completed!"; // Return value when the task finishes
}
```

3. `co_yield`:
The `co_yield` keyword is used to suspend the execution of a coroutine and pass a value back to the caller. It allows a coroutine to provide multiple results or intermediate values during its execution.

Example usage:
```cpp
std::generator<int> generateNumbers() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        co_yield i; // Yield each number in the range
    }
}
```

Conclusion:
C++ coroutines introduce new keywords and syntax to handle asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner. Understanding and effectively utilizing keywords such as `co_await`, `co_return`, and `co_yield` is key to harnessing the power of coroutines in C++. By leveraging these syntax elements, developers can write cleaner and more maintainable asynchronous code.
