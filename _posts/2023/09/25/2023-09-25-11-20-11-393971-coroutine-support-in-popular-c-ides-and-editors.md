C++20 introduced coroutines, a powerful feature that simplifies asynchronous programming. Coroutines allow developers to write asynchronous code in a sequential and more readable manner. However, to fully leverage the benefits of coroutines, it is essential to have proper support in our development environment.

In this blog post, we will explore the level of coroutine support in popular C++ IDEs and editors, making it easier for you to choose the best tool for your development needs.

## Visual Studio (including Visual Studio Code) 

### Support Level: High

Visual Studio, both the full-fledged IDE and Visual Studio Code, offer robust support for coroutines. They provide features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and static analysis for coroutine-related keywords and constructs. Additionally, Visual Studio allows you to debug coroutines, providing a seamless debugging experience for asynchronous code.

## CLion

### Support Level: Moderate

CLion, a popular C++ IDE from JetBrains, offers decent support for coroutines. It provides syntax highlighting and code completion for coroutine-related keywords. However, the debugging experience for coroutines in CLion is not as smooth as in Visual Studio.

## Xcode

### Support Level: Basic

Xcode, the IDE for Apple platforms, provides basic support for coroutines. It offers syntax highlighting for coroutine keywords but lacks advanced features like code completion and debugging support specific to coroutines.

## Sublime Text

### Support Level: Low

Sublime Text, a lightweight yet feature-rich text editor, has limited support for coroutines. It provides syntax highlighting for coroutine keywords, but advanced features like code completion and debugging support are not available out of the box. However, you can enhance Sublime Text's coroutine support by installing community-developed plugins.

## Vim and Emacs

### Support Level: Community plugins available

Vim and Emacs, popular text editors among experienced developers, have community-supported plugins that provide basic coroutine support. These plugins can offer syntax highlighting and limited code completion for coroutine-related keywords. However, the level of support may vary depending on the plugin and its maintenance.

## Conclusion

When working with coroutines in C++, choosing the right IDE or editor can significantly impact your development experience. IDEs like Visual Studio and CLion provide excellent support for coroutines, making it easier to write, debug, and maintain asynchronous code. Text editors like Sublime Text, Vim, and Emacs offer more basic support, requiring the installation of additional plugins to enhance coroutine functionality.

Remember, the level of support for coroutines in IDEs and editors can vary as updates and improvements are made over time. Always stay updated with the latest versions of your preferred development environment to ensure you have the best coroutine support available.
