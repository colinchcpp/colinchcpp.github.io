When developing software applications for a global audience, **internationalization** (i18n) becomes a crucial aspect to consider. It involves adapting your software to different languages, cultures, and regions. In this blog post, we will compare two popular cross-platform frameworks, wxWidgets and Qt, to determine which one offers better support for internationalization.

## wxWidgets

wxWidgets is a mature and widely-used C++ framework that allows developers to create native-looking applications for various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It provides comprehensive support for internationalization through its built-in features and libraries.

**Key features of wxWidgets' internationalization support:**

1. **Message catalogs**: wxWidgets offers a unique message catalog system for translating the user interface (UI) strings. This approach allows developers to extract translatable strings from their code and separate them into separate .po files, improving the translation process.

2. **Unicode support**: wxWidgets fully supports Unicode, enabling developers to handle different character sets and languages effortlessly. This is especially useful when dealing with non-Latin languages and complex writing systems.

3. **Localization tools**: wxWidgets provides helpful tools, such as the `wxLocale` class, which simplifies the process of adapting the application to different languages and cultures. It allows developers to set the appropriate locale and automatically updates the UI language.

## Qt

Qt is another popular cross-platform framework renowned for its powerful and flexible features. It offers extensive support for internationalization, making it an excellent choice for developing multi-lingual applications.

**Key features of Qt's internationalization support:**

1. **Translation framework**: Qt includes a comprehensive translation framework that makes it easy to localize UI strings. It provides the `QObject::tr()` function for marking translatable strings in the code, which can be extracted and translated using the Qt Linguist tool.

2. **Plurals and context support**: Qt's translation system allows for handling plural forms and context-specific translations, which is crucial for accurate localization in languages with complex grammatical rules.

3. **Language code support**: Qt supports ISO language codes, making it simple to handle language-specific behavior. It provides language-specific classes (e.g., `QLocale`) to manage various cultural aspects, such as date and time formatting, currency, and number representation.

## Conclusion

Both wxWidgets and Qt offer robust support for internationalization, making them viable options for developing globalized applications. While wxWidgets provides a distinct message catalog system and comprehensive Unicode support, Qt boasts a powerful translation framework with features like plurals and context support. Ultimately, the choice between these two frameworks depends on the specific requirements of your project and your familiarity with the respective APIs.
