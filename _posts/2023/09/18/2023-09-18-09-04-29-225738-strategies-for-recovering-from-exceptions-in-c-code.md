When writing C++ code, it is important to have strategies in place to handle exceptions effectively. Exceptions are thrown when unexpected conditions or errors occur during the execution of a program. By implementing proper exception handling techniques, you can ensure that your program gracefully recovers from these exceptions and continues to run smoothly. Here are some strategies for recovering from exceptions in C++ code:

## 1. Use try-catch blocks

A **try-catch** block is the most common way to handle exceptions in C++ code. Within a try block, you write the code that may throw an exception. If an exception is thrown, it can be caught and handled in one or more catch blocks. Wrap the code that may throw an exception within the try block, and catch the specific exception types in catch blocks. By catching the appropriate exceptions, you can take appropriate recovery actions.

```cpp
try {
  // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (ExceptionType1& e) {
  // Exception handling code for ExceptionType1
}
catch (ExceptionType2& e) {
  // Exception handling code for ExceptionType2
}
// catch more exception types if needed
```

## 2. Define custom exception classes

C++ allows you to define your own custom exception classes by inheriting from the `std::exception` class or any of its derived classes. Defining custom exception classes can provide more specific information about the type of exception and aid in better error handling. For example:

```cpp
#include <exception>
#include <string>

class FileNotFoundException : public std::exception {
public:
  FileNotFoundException(const std::string& filename)
    : m_filename(filename) {}

  const char* what() const noexcept override {
    return ("File not found: " + m_filename).c_str();
  }

private:
  std::string m_filename;
};
```

## Conclusion

By using try-catch blocks and defining custom exception classes, you can effectively recover from exceptions in your C++ code. Handling exceptions gracefully is crucial for ensuring that your program continues running correctly, even in cases of unexpected errors or conditions. Use these strategies to enhance the robustness and reliability of your C++ applications.
