When working with a relational database in C++, it is crucial to ensure exception safety. Exception safety refers to the ability of code to handle exceptions without compromising the integrity of data or causing resource leaks.

In this blog post, we will explore some best practices for achieving exception safety in C++ code that interfaces with relational databases.

## 1. Use RAII for Resource Management

Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) is a popular C++ programming technique that ensures resources are properly managed. When working with databases, *connection*, *statement*, and *result set* objects should be managed using RAII principles.

By encapsulating these database objects in RAII classes, we can rely on their destructors to automatically release resources when an exception occurs. This guarantees that database connections are properly closed, statements are deallocated, and result sets are cleaned up, even in the presence of exceptions.

```cpp
class Connection {
public:
  Connection() {
    // open a connection
  }

  ~Connection() {
    // close the connection
  }

  // ...
};

void performDatabaseOperation() {
  Connection connection;
  // ...
}
```

## 2. Catch and Handle Exceptions Appropriately

When interacting with a database, it is essential to catch and handle exceptions appropriately. This includes distinguishing between transient and non-transient exceptions. Transient exceptions represent temporary errors, such as network issues, while non-transient exceptions indicate more serious problems, such as an inaccessible database.

By catching transient exceptions, you can gracefully handle the error scenario and possibly retry the operation. On the other hand, non-transient exceptions should be propagated up the call stack or logged for further investigation.

```cpp
try {
  // perform database operation
} catch (const TransientException& ex) {
  // handle transient exception (e.g., retry logic)
} catch (const NonTransientException& ex) {
  // rethrow or log non-transient exception
}
```

## Conclusion

Exception safety is crucial when writing C++ code that interfaces with relational databases. By leveraging RAII for resource management and handling exceptions appropriately, you can ensure the integrity of data and prevent resource leaks in the presence of exceptions.

Following these best practices will help you create robust and reliable code for working with relational databases in C++.
