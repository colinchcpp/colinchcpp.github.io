In C++ programming, it is common to check if a particular type exists or to perform type traits operations based on the presence or absence of certain types. One of the challenges faced when dealing with type traits is that if the type being checked does not exist, it can result in compiler errors and make the code more difficult to debug.

Fortunately, C++17 introduced a new helper mechanism called `std::void_t` that makes it easier to handle nonexistent types in type traits. This feature allows us to check if a type exists and perform certain operations depending on the outcome.

### What is `std::void_t`?

`std::void_t` is a template metafunction that takes any number of template arguments but discards them. It always evaluates to `void`. By using `std::void_t`, we can create a type trait that conditionally selects a type based on its existence.

### Using `std::void_t` to handle nonexistent types

Let's see an example where `std::void_t` can be used effectively. Imagine we have a type trait `has_member_function_foo` that checks if a class has a member function named `foo`:

```cpp
template<typename, typename = std::void_t<>>
struct has_member_function_foo : std::false_type {};

template<typename T>
struct has_member_function_foo<T, std::void_t<decltype(std::declval<T>().foo())>> : std::true_type {};
```

In the above code snippet, we define a primary template for `has_member_function_foo` where the default template argument is `std::void_t`. This defaults the trait to `false`. However, if the expression `std::declval<T>().foo()` is well-formed, the specialization for `has_member_function_foo` with `std::void_t` of the member function type is selected, making the trait `true`.

Now, using `has_member_function_foo`, we can conditionally enable certain functionality for types that have the member function `foo`:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void do_something(T& obj)
{
    if constexpr(has_member_function_foo<T>::value)
    {
        obj.foo();
    }
    else
    {
        // Handle types without foo()
    }
}
```

In the above example, if `T` has a member function `foo`, it will be invoked. Otherwise, a fallback behavior can be implemented.

### Benefits of using `std::void_t`

By using `std::void_t`, we can write more concise and versatile type traits that handle the presence or absence of types more elegantly. It eliminates the need for cumbersome workaround techniques, like using `decltype` and SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error), for checking type existence.

### Conclusion

`std::void_t` is a powerful tool in C++ for handling nonexistent types in type traits. It simplifies the code and eliminates the need for complex workarounds. By leveraging `std::void_t`, we can write cleaner and more robust code that handles type traits gracefully, even in the presence of nonexistent types.
