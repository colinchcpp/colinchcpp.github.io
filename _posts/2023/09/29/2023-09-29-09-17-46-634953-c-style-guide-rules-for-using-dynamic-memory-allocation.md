In C++, dynamic memory allocation is a powerful feature that allows programs to allocate and deallocate memory at runtime. However, it can also lead to memory leaks and other issues if not used correctly. Adhering to a set of style guide rules can help ensure safe and efficient use of dynamic memory allocation in your code.

## 1. Use Smart Pointers

**#CPP #MemoryManagement**

Using smart pointers, such as `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`, is highly recommended over manual memory management with raw pointers. These smart pointers automatically deallocate memory when they go out of scope, preventing memory leaks. Additionally, they provide memory safety and exception handling, making your code more robust.

```cpp
#include <memory>

void example() {
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42);
    // Smart pointer automatically deallocates memory when it goes out of scope
}
```

## 2. Avoid Raw Pointers Unless Necessary

**#CPP #DynamicMemory**

Avoid using raw pointers unless absolutely necessary. Raw pointers require manual memory management and are more error-prone. Instead, prefer smart pointers or standard containers like `std::vector` or `std::array` that handle memory allocation and deallocation for you.

```cpp
#include <vector>

void example() {
    std::vector<int> nums {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    // No need to manage memory explicitly with raw pointers
}
```

## 3. Be Mindful of Memory Leaks

**#CPP #MemoryLeaks**

Ensure that memory allocated with `new` or `new[]` is properly deallocated with `delete` or `delete[]`. Failing to do so will result in memory leaks.

```cpp
void example() {
    int* ptr = new int(42);
    // Do something with ptr
    
    delete ptr; // Deallocate memory
    
    // Avoid forgetting to deallocate memory, use smart pointers for safer alternatives
}
```

## 4. Allocate Arrays with `new[]`, Deallocate with `delete[]`

**#CPP #DynamicArrays**

When allocating memory for arrays, use `new[]` instead of `new`. Correspondingly, deallocate the memory with `delete[]` instead of `delete`. Using `delete` instead of `delete[]` to deallocate an array can lead to undefined behavior.

```cpp
void example() {
    int* arr = new int[5];
    // Do something with arr
    
    delete[] arr; // Deallocate memory for array
}
```

## 5. Avoid Mixing Memory Allocation Methods

**#CPP #MemoryManagement**

Avoid mixing different memory allocation methods, such as mixing `new` with `malloc()` or `free()`. Different allocation methods have different ways of managing memory, and mixing them can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

```cpp
void example() {
    int* ptr1 = new int(42);
    int* ptr2 = static_cast<int*>(malloc(sizeof(int))); // Avoid mixing allocation methods
    
    // ...
    
    delete ptr1;
    free(ptr2); // Important: Use matching deallocation method
    
    // Prefer using consistent memory allocation methods
}
```

Following these C++ style guide rules for dynamic memory allocation will help produce cleaner and safer code. It is always recommended to use abstraction mechanisms like smart pointers and standard containers to handle memory management, reducing the chances of memory leaks and other memory-related issues.
