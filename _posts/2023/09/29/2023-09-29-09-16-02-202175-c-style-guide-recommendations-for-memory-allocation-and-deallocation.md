In C++, managing memory allocation and deallocation is crucial for efficient and error-free code. Following a consistent and reliable style guide can help ensure that memory is properly handled. This guide provides recommendations for memory allocation and deallocation in C++.

## 1. Use Smart Pointers

Smart pointers, such as `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, are preferred over raw pointers. They automatically release memory when it is no longer needed, reducing the risk of memory leaks.

## 2. Avoid Raw Pointers Whenever Possible

Raw pointers should be used sparingly and only when necessary. It is best to rely on smart pointers or containers like `std::vector` whenever possible, as they handle memory management more reliably.

## 3. Allocate Memory with `new`, Deallocate with `delete`

When directly allocating memory with `new`, always deallocate it with `delete` to avoid memory leaks. Avoid mismatching allocation and deallocation methods (e.g., `new` with `delete[]`).

```cpp
int* ptr = new int;  // Allocation
// ...
delete ptr;         // Deallocation
```

## 4. Allocate Arrays with `new[]`, Deallocate with `delete[]`

When allocating memory for arrays, use `new[]` and `delete[]` to ensure proper memory management.

```cpp
int* arr = new int[10];  // Array allocation
// ...
delete[] arr;           // Array deallocation
```

## 5. Prefer Container Classes

Instead of manually managing memory for dynamic arrays, prefer using container classes like `std::vector`. They handle memory allocation and deallocation automatically, minimizing the risk of errors.

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> vec;  // Dynamic array allocation and deallocation
vec.push_back(42);
// ...
vec.clear();           // Deallocation done automatically
```

## 6. Document Ownership of Allocated Memory

If you are passing ownership of dynamically allocated memory to another object or function, clearly document this in your code. This helps prevent memory leaks and ensures proper deallocation at the appropriate time.

## Conclusion

Following these recommendations for memory allocation and deallocation in C++ can greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of your code. By utilizing smart pointers, avoiding raw pointers whenever possible, and using container classes, you can minimize memory leaks and improve the overall reliability of your program.
