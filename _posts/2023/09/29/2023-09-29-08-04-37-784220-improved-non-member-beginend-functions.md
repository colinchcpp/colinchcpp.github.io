Iterators play a crucial role in C++, offering a way to traverse through elements in a range, such as an array or a container. Starting from C++11, the introduction of the `begin` and `end` member functions made it easier to access the first and one-past-the-last elements of a range using the dot operator. However, non-member versions of these functions were lacking, causing inconvenience and verbosity in certain scenarios.

With the release of C++20, **non-member `begin`/`end` functions** were introduced as a part of the [Iterator Range Library Proposal](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0896r0.pdf). The purpose of these non-member functions is to provide consistency between member and non-member functions, making it easier to write generic code that works seamlessly with any iterator type.

In earlier versions of C++, it was common to write code like this:

```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (auto it = numbers.begin(); it != numbers.end(); ++it) {
    // Process the element
}
```

The non-member `begin`/`end` functions eliminate the need for explicit function calls on the container object. Instead, they allow us to write the above code in a simpler and more expressive way:

```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (auto it = begin(numbers); it != end(numbers); ++it) {
    // Process the element
}
```

This improvement has several benefits:

### 1. Adherence to Generic Programming Principles

Using non-member `begin`/`end` functions aligns with the principles of generic programming, where operations should work uniformly across different types. By providing non-member versions, the standard library ensures that code relying on these functions can seamlessly handle a variety of iterator types, including user-defined ones.

### 2. Enhanced Expressiveness and Clarity

The use of non-member `begin`/`end` functions adds clarity to the code by explicitly stating the intention to access the range's beginning and end. This makes the code more readable and reduces the cognitive load when understanding and maintaining it.

### Conclusion
The introduction of non-member `begin`/`end` functions in C++20 greatly improves the standard library by aligning member and non-member functions and promoting generic coding practices. With this enhancement, developers can write more expressive and concise code that adheres to best practices. When writing new code or updating existing code, consider using these functions to improve the clarity and compatibility of your code.
