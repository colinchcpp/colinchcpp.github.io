When developing C++ code, it is essential to follow a consistent style guide for organizing and documenting your classes. This not only improves code readability but also ensures maintainability and collaboration within a development team. In this blog post, we will outline some important rules to consider when organizing and documenting your C++ classes.

## 1. Class Organization

### 1.1. #include Statements
- Begin each header file with necessary `#include` statements, including the ones for standard libraries.
- Group `#include` statements into logical sections (e.g., external libraries, internal project headers) and separate them with an empty line.

### 1.2. Class Declaration
- Place forward declarations of inner classes, structs, or enums above the class declaration.
- Order the member functions in a logical and consistent manner. Group related functions together (e.g., constructors, destructor, getters/setters, utility functions) and separate the groups with an empty line.

### 1.3. Public Interface
- Declare only the necessary public member variables, keeping the interface as minimal as possible.
- Avoid exposing implementation details through public member variables. Instead, use getter and setter functions to access and modify them.

### 1.4. Private and Protected Sections
- Group private and protected member variables together, separating them from the public section with an empty line.
- Declare member variables or functions, in the order of their initialization or use. This helps to improve readability and understandability of the class implementation.

## 2. Documentation

### 2.1. Comments
- Use descriptive comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each class, member variable, and member function.
- Include comments for non-obvious or complex code blocks to enhance code comprehension.
- Document any assumptions, preconditions, or postconditions for member functions.
- Update comments when making changes to code to ensure accuracy and relevance.

### 2.2. Function Headers
- Document each member function with a descriptive header comment, explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.
- Use [Doxygen-style](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) comments to generate automatic documentation if applicable.

### 2.3. Class-Level Documentation
- Provide a high-level overview of the class's purpose, responsibilities, and usage in a header comment at the top of the class declaration.

### 2.4. Consistency
- Be consistent with the chosen documentation style throughout the codebase.
- Follow naming conventions for classes, functions, variables, and comments to maintain clarity and readability.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your C++ code is well-organized and properly documented, making it easier to understand, maintain, and collaborate on. Happy coding!
