Templates are a powerful feature in C++ that allow us to write generic code to work with different types effortlessly. However, to maintain code readability and ensure consistency across a project, it is essential to have guidelines for using templates in C++ style guides. In this blog post, we will discuss some best practices and recommendations for using templates effectively.

## 1. Avoid Excessive Template Instantiations

One common pitfall when working with templates is generating excessive template instantiations. Each instantiation of a template creates a new version of the code, which can lead to code bloat and longer compilation times. To mitigate this, it is recommended to **minimize unnecessary template instantiations**.

To achieve this, consider using **explicit template instantiation** for commonly used types. Explicit instantiation allows you to define specific instances of the template that will be used in the code, reducing the number of implicit instantiations.

```cpp
template class MyClass<int>;  // Explicitly instantiate MyClass for int
template class MyClass<float>;  // Explicitly instantiate MyClass for float
```

## 2. Provide Clear and Descriptive Template Parameters

When defining templates, it is crucial to provide clear and descriptive **template parameter names**. This helps users of your code understand the intent and purpose of each parameter. Consider using meaningful names that convey the role of the parameter in the template.

```cpp
// Example of clear and descriptive template parameter names
template <typename ValueType, typename ComparatorType, size_t MaxSize>
class MyContainer {
   //...
};
```

## 3. Document Template Requirements and Usage

Template classes and functions can have specific requirements for their template parameters. It is important to **document the requirements** for each template parameter and provide examples of valid types to use. This helps other developers understand how to correctly use your template.

Additionally, consider providing clear documentation on how to **instantiate and use the template**. This might include information about required header files, expected behavior, and any specific rules or considerations.

## 4. Test Templates with a Wide Range of Types

To ensure the correctness and efficiency of your template code, it is essential to test it with various types. **Test templates** with both primitive types and complex user-defined types to verify that the code works as expected. This also helps identify any performance issues or corner cases that might arise with different types.

## 5. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle

Templates allow us to write reusable code, but it is crucial to **follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle**. If you find yourself duplicating code or logic across different template specializations, consider refactoring the code to eliminate duplicate sections. This promotes maintainability and readability of the codebase.

## Conclusion

Templates are a powerful tool in C++ that can significantly improve code flexibility and reusability. By following these guidelines for using templates in C++ style guides, you can ensure that your code is clean, efficient, and easy to understand by other developers. Use explicit template instantiations, provide clear template parameter names, document requirements, and test with different types for comprehensive coverage. Following these best practices will contribute to well-designed and maintainable C++ codebases.
