C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that has evolved over the years to include various features and improvements. One such enhancement is the support for `constexpr` containers like vectors and spans, which provides developers with more flexibility and control in compile-time computations. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of `constexpr` vector and span and how they can be utilized in modern C++ development.

## What is `constexpr`?

`constexpr` is a keyword in C++ that allows the evaluation of an expression at compile-time. This means that the value of the expression is known and can be computed by the compiler, eliminating the need to perform such calculations at runtime. Using `constexpr` effectively can lead to improved performance and optimized code.

## `constexpr` vector

Traditionally, vectors in C++ are dynamic arrays that can be resized at runtime. However, with the introduction of `constexpr` in C++11, it is now possible to create vectors that are evaluated and initialized at compile-time. This is particularly useful when dealing with fixed-size containers that do not need to be modified during runtime.

Here's an example of a `constexpr` vector:

```cpp
#include <vector>

constexpr std::vector<int> values = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

In the above code snippet, the `values` vector is created as a `constexpr` container, allowing its elements to be evaluated and initialized at compile-time. This can be beneficial in scenarios where constant data is required for computations or template metaprogramming.

## `constexpr` span

A span is a lightweight view of a contiguous sequence of objects, such as an array or a vector. It allows accessing and manipulating elements within the sequence without owning the underlying data. Starting from C++20, spans can also be declared as `constexpr`, providing an additional level of flexibility.

Here's an example of a `constexpr` span:

```cpp
#include <span>

constexpr std::span<int> values_span = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

The `values_span` is a `constexpr` span that references the elements of the `constexpr` vector `values`. This means that the span itself can be evaluated at compile-time and used in various compile-time computations.

## Benefits of `constexpr` containers

The support for `constexpr` vectors and spans brings several benefits to C++ developers. Some notable advantages include:

- **Performance improvements**: `constexpr` containers allow initialization and evaluation of data at compile-time, reducing runtime overhead and improving performance.
- **Compile-time computations**: `constexpr` containers can be used in compile-time computations, enabling complex calculations to be performed at compile-time rather than runtime.
- **Template metaprogramming**: The ability to use `constexpr` containers in templates expands the possibilities of template metaprogramming, enabling advanced compile-time code generation.

## Conclusion

The introduction of `constexpr` support for vectors and spans in C++ provides developers with new opportunities for optimizing code, improving performance, and enabling advanced compile-time computations. By leveraging `constexpr` containers, programmers can unlock the power of compile-time evaluation and initialization, leading to more efficient and flexible C++ code.
