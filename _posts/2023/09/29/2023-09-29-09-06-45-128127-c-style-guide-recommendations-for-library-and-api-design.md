When developing libraries and APIs in C++, following a consistent and well-defined coding style is essential for ensuring readability, maintainability, and ease of use for other developers. This C++ style guide provides recommendations and best practices for designing libraries and APIs in C++.

## 1. Naming Conventions

Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers. Follow these conventions:

- Use camel case for variable and function names (e.g., `myVariable`, `calculateSum`).
- Use Pascal case for class and struct names (e.g., `MyClass`, `PersonData`).
- Prefix member variables with 'm_' (e.g., `m_count`, `m_data`).
- Avoid using all caps for constants, instead, use upper camel case (e.g., `MAX_SIZE`).
- Avoid single-letter variable names unless they are used in well-established mathematical or conventional contexts.

## 2. API Design

When designing an API, aim for simplicity, consistency, and ease of use. Follow these guidelines:

- Use clear and intuitive function names that reflect their purpose.
- Favor function parameters over global variables to provide flexibility and reusability.
- Use exceptions for error handling instead of returning error codes.
- Avoid exposing raw pointers in the API; use smart pointers or containers instead.
- Prefer function overloading instead of using default arguments to avoid confusion.
- Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the API, including usage examples and specifications for each function.

## 3. Memory Management

Efficient memory management is crucial in C++. Follow these best practices:

- Avoid manual memory management whenever possible. Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) idiom and smart pointers to handle memory automatically.
- Consider using move semantics and rvalue references to optimize memory usage and avoid unnecessary copying.
- Properly deallocate dynamically allocated memory using `delete` for single objects and `delete[]` for arrays.
- Implement the Rule of 5 (or 3) to manage resource acquisition and release effectively.

## 4. Error Handling

Effective error handling enhances the stability and usability of a library or API. Adhere to these recommendations:

- Use exceptions for reporting errors and exceptional conditions.
- Provide clear and meaningful error messages to assist developers in debugging.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and avoid leaking resources.
- Document the possible exceptions thrown by each function in the API documentation.

## 5. Documentation

Clear and comprehensive documentation is essential for developers using your library or API. Consider these tips:

- Include a brief introduction and overview of the library's purpose and features.
- Document each class, function, and data structure, including their parameters, return values, and exceptions thrown.
- Provide usage examples and code snippets to demonstrate how to use the library effectively.
- Use consistent formatting and style throughout the documentation.
- Consider using Doxygen or other documentation generators to automate the process.

## 6. Testing

Writing tests for your library or API ensures its correctness and identifies potential issues. Consider these testing guidelines:

- Implement unit tests to verify the functionality of individual functions or classes.
- Use a testing framework like Google Test or Catch2 for writing and executing tests.
- Test various edge cases and error scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability.
- Automate your test suite and integrate it into your development workflow.

By following these C++ style guide recommendations for library and API design, you can improve the quality, usability, and maintainability of your codebase, making it easier for other developers to utilize and contribute to your project.
