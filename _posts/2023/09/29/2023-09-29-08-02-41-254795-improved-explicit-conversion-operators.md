With the release of C# 9.0, explicit conversion operators have been improved to provide more concise and expressive code. This enhancement allows for better control over conversion between different data types, making code more readable and ensuring fewer runtime errors. In this blog post, we will explore the improvements in explicit conversion operators and how they can be utilized in your C# projects.

## The Need for Explicit Conversion Operators

In C#, implicit conversion operators are used to automatically convert one type to another, while explicit conversion operators require an explicit cast. This allows developers to define how a type is converted to another type, providing flexibility and control. However, prior to C# 9.0, implementing explicit conversion operators was often verbose and involved a lot of boilerplate code.

## Simplified Syntax with C# 9.0

C# 9.0 introduces a simplified syntax for defining explicit conversion operators. The new syntax reduces the amount of repetitive code and increases readability. Let's take a look at an example:

```csharp
public class Temperature
{
    private double value;

    public Temperature(double value)
    {
        this.value = value;
    }

    // Old syntax for explicit conversion operator
    public static explicit operator Fahrenheit(Temperature temperature)
    {
        return new Fahrenheit(temperature.value * 9 / 5 + 32);
    }

    // New syntax for explicit conversion operator (C# 9.0)
    public static Fahrenheit operator Fahrenheit(Temperature temperature)
    {
        return new Fahrenheit(temperature.value * 9 / 5 + 32);
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `Temperature` class that represents a temperature value in Celsius. We want to define an explicit conversion operator to convert a `Temperature` object to a `Fahrenheit` object.

In C# 8.0 and earlier, the `explicit` keyword was used before the `operator` keyword to indicate that the conversion is explicit. However, in C# 9.0, the `explicit` keyword is no longer required, making the code more concise.

## Benefits of Improved Explicit Conversion Operators

The simplified syntax for explicit conversion operators in C# 9.0 brings several benefits:

### 1. Reduced Boilerplate Code

With the new syntax, you no longer need to include the `explicit` keyword, leading to less boilerplate code. The code becomes more focused on the actual implementation of the conversion logic.

### 2. Improved Readability

The removal of the `explicit` keyword makes the code more readable by eliminating unnecessary noise. It is now easier to understand the intended conversion by simply looking at the operator declaration.

### 3. Enhanced Consistency

The new syntax aligns more closely with the existing implicit conversion operators in C#. This brings consistency to the language and allows developers to easily distinguish between implicit and explicit conversions.

## Conclusion

The improved explicit conversion operators in C# 9.0 provide a simplified syntax, reducing boilerplate code and improving readability. This enhancement brings consistency to the language and allows for better control over conversions between different types.

By utilizing these improved explicit conversion operators, you can write cleaner and more expressive code, resulting in more maintainable and error-free applications.
