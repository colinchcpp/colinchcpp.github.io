# Introduction

In C++ programming, handling errors and exceptions is a crucial aspect of writing robust and maintainable code. Two common approaches for error handling are using exceptions and error codes. Both have their advantages and trade-offs, and it is important to establish consistent guidelines for their usage in a C++ style guide. In this blog post, we will discuss the considerations and provide some guidelines for using exceptions and error codes in C++.

## Exceptions

Exceptions provide a structured and intuitive way to handle errors in C++. They allow for the separation of error handling code from the normal control flow, enabling cleaner and more readable code. Here are some guidelines for using exceptions:

1. **Use exceptions for exceptional conditions**: Exceptions should be reserved for situations that are truly exceptional, such as runtime errors or other unrecoverable conditions. Avoid using exceptions for expected or recoverable errors.

2. **Throw appropriate exception types**: Use meaningful exception types to provide concise error information. Standard exception classes like `std::runtime_error`, `std::logic_error`, or custom exception classes can be used as appropriate.

3. **Catch specific exceptions**: Catch specific exception types rather than catching the base exception class (`std::exception`) whenever possible. This allows for better error handling and avoids unintended catches.

4. **Propagate exceptions responsibly**: Unless you can handle an exception locally, propagate it up the call stack by either rethrowing the exception or using appropriate exception specifications. This ensures that the error is handled at an appropriate level.

## Error Codes

Error codes have been a traditional approach for error handling in C and C++ programs. While they lack some of the benefits of exceptions, they can still be useful in certain scenarios. Here are some guidelines for using error codes:

1. **Use error codes for expected conditions**: Error codes are suitable for expected or recoverable conditions that are part of the normal program flow. Examples include indicating the end of a file or a successful operation that was performed.

2. **Establish clear error code conventions**: Define a clear set of error codes and their meanings to maintain consistency across the codebase. Avoid using arbitrary integer values as error codes, and instead define meaningful constants or enums.

3. **Check error codes diligently**: Always check error codes after the execution of functions that return them. Neglecting to check error codes can lead to subtle bugs or unexpected behavior.

4. **Provide failure handling mechanisms**: Along with error codes, provide mechanisms to handle and propagate failures appropriately. This might involve returning special values, using out parameters, or other techniques as dictated by your coding standards.

## Conclusion

In summary, both exceptions and error codes have their place in C++ error handling. Exceptions are best suited for exceptional or unrecoverable conditions, providing a clean separation of error handling code. On the other hand, error codes are more appropriate for expected and recoverable conditions that are part of the normal program flow.

Having clear guidelines in your C++ style guide for when to use exceptions vs. error codes ensures consistency and promotes code readability and maintainability. By following these guidelines, you can make informed decisions about which approach to use in different scenarios, leading to robust and resilient C++ codebases.
