When writing robust and error-free code, it is crucial to validate and enforce certain conditions. In C++, one way to achieve this is by using *preconditions* and *postconditions*. These conditions help ensure that inputs are valid before a function is executed and that the function produces the expected results afterward.

The C++ Standard Library provides the `std::assert` function, which is a powerful tool for validating conditions. In this blog post, we will explore how to use `std::assert` effectively to simplify the validation process and improve code reliability.

## Precondition validation with `std::assert`

Preconditions are conditions that must be true before a function is called. These conditions often involve validating input parameters or checking the state of the system. Instead of writing **if-else** statements to manually check these conditions, we can leverage the simplicity and power of `std::assert`.

```cpp
#include <cassert>

int divide(int a, int b) {
    /* Preconditions */
    assert(b != 0); // b must not be zero

    return a / b;
}
```

In the code snippet above, we use `std::assert` to verify that the value of `b` is not equal to zero. If the condition is false, the `std::assert` function will trigger an assertion failure and provide a clear error message indicating the violated precondition.

By using `std::assert`, we eliminate the need for writing manual checks, making the code more concise and readable. Additionally, it greatly simplifies the debugging process by providing helpful error messages during development.

## Postcondition validation with `std::assert`

Postconditions are conditions that must be true after a function has executed. These conditions help ensure that the function produces the expected results. Similar to preconditions, `std::assert` can be used to validate postconditions as well.

```cpp
#include <cassert>

int multiply(int a, int b) {
    int result = a * b;

    /* Postconditions */
    assert(result > 0); // Result should be greater than zero

    return result;
}
```

In the code snippet above, we use `std::assert` to ensure that the result of the multiplication is greater than zero. If the condition fails, `std::assert` will trigger an assertion failure, signaling that the function has produced an unexpected result.

Validating postconditions with `std::assert` provides a valuable safety net during development. It helps catch and resolve potential issues early on, preventing subsequent code execution with incorrect results.

## Conclusion

Using `std::assert` for validating preconditions and postconditions simplifies the code and improves its reliability. It eliminates the need for manual checks, resulting in more concise and readable code. Additionally, `std::assert` provides helpful error messages during debugging, making it easier to identify and fix problematic areas.

Remember to use assertions appropriately and judiciously. While `std::assert` is useful during development and debugging, it is important to disable assertions in release builds for performance reasons.

By leveraging the power of `std::assert`, C++ developers can write more robust code with confidence, ensuring that functions are called with valid inputs and produce the expected results.
