Error handling is an integral part of software development, ensuring that applications gracefully handle unexpected situations. Traditional error handling through exceptions or error codes can sometimes be complex and error-prone. The introduction of the `std::expected` type in the C++ standard library provides a modern solution for more robust and expressive error handling.

`std::expected` is a popular proposal to the C++ standard library that provides a type-safe way to represent both expected values and error conditions. It combines the benefits of `std::variant` and `std::optional` to create a powerful tool for handling errors in a concise and expressive manner.

To start using `std::expected`, you need to include the `<expected>` header in your C++ code. The following example demonstrates how `std::expected` can be used to deal with possible errors when parsing a string into an integer:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <expected>

std::expected<int, std::string> parseInteger(const std::string& str) {
    try {
        int value = std::stoi(str);
        return value;
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        return std::make_error<std::string>(e.what());
    }
}

int main() {
    std::string input = "123456";
    auto result = parseInteger(input);

    if (result) {
        std::cout << "Parsed integer: " << *result << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << result.error() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `parseInteger` function attempts to parse a given string into an integer. If successful, it returns an `std::expected<int, std::string>` containing the parsed integer value. Otherwise, it returns an `std::expected<int, std::string>` with an error message.

In the `main` function, we call `parseInteger` with a valid input string. We can then check whether the result contains a value (`result`) or an error (`result.error()`) using the boolean context and the `error` member function, respectively. This approach ensures that we handle potential errors explicitly and avoid any unexpected behavior.

By utilizing `std::expected`, we achieve code that is both more readable and robust. Errors are treated as objects and can be handled concisely with `if` statements, avoiding the need for complex exception handling blocks or cumbersome error code checks.

Overall, `std::expected` provides a modern and intuitive way to handle errors in C++. Its integration with existing C++ features makes it a valuable addition to any codebase, improving both the clarity and reliability of error handling.
