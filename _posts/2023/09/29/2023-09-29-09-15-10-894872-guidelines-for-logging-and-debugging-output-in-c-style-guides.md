When writing C++ code, it is essential to implement proper logging and debugging techniques to help identify and fix issues efficiently. This blog post will outline some guidelines for logging and debugging output, which can be incorporated into your C++ style guide.

## 1. Use Proper Logging Levels

In order to effectively analyze and debug your code, it's crucial to implement different logging levels. These levels allow you to categorize and filter log messages based on their importance and severity. Common logging levels include:

- **`DEBUG`**: Used for detailed debugging information.
- **`INFO`**: Used to provide general information about the execution flow.
- **`WARNING`**: Used to indicate potential issues or unexpected behavior.
- **`ERROR`**: Used for critical errors that require immediate attention.
- **`FATAL`**: Used for fatal errors that cause program termination.

By using these logging levels, you can filter log messages based on their severity, making it easier to identify and address issues.

## 2. Provide Meaningful Log Messages

When logging events or errors, it is important to provide descriptive and meaningful log messages. A well-written log message should include relevant information such as:

- Contextual information: Include details about the component, module, or function where the log message originates.
- Timestamp: Add a timestamp to each log message, enabling chronological analysis of the log data.
- Error codes or error-specific information: If an error occurs, include any relevant error codes or specific details to assist in troubleshooting.
- Stack trace: In case of exceptions or errors, including a stack trace can be immensely helpful in identifying the root cause.

## 3. Use Log Formatting and Structured Logging

To make log analysis easier, it's important to adopt a consistent log message format throughout your codebase. This will enable automated log parsing and processing. Consider using formats like JSON or syslog-style logging to capture structured information.

Structured logging allows you to add key-value pairs to your log messages, providing additional context and making log analysis more efficient. Some popular libraries for structured logging in C++ include spdlog, Google's Glog, and Boost.Log.

## 4. Enable Debugging Tools and Compiler Flags

In addition to logging, take advantage of debugging tools and compiler flags provided by your development environment. Tools like IDE debuggers, profilers, and memory analyzers can help identify and fix issues during the development and testing phases.

Using compiler flags that enable additional debug information and checks, such as `-g` or `-fsanitize`, can also aid in debugging by providing more detailed error messages and identifying potential undefined behaviors.

## Conclusion

By incorporating these guidelines into your C++ style guide, you can establish best practices for logging and debugging output. Following these practices consistently will make it easier to identify issues, troubleshoot errors, and maintain a clean and reliable codebase.
