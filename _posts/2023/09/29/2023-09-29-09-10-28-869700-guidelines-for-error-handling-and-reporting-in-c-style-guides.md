Error handling and reporting are crucial aspects of writing robust and maintainable code. A well-defined and consistent approach to error handling can help improve the reliability and readability of your C++ codebase. In this blog post, we will discuss some guidelines to follow for effective error handling and reporting in C++.

## 1. Use Exceptions for exceptional conditions

Exceptions provide a structured mechanism for handling exceptional conditions in C++. Use them to handle error scenarios that are "exceptional" and cannot be easily dealt with in the normal control flow. Exceptions provide a clear separation between error handling code and the business logic, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

```cpp
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (const SomeException& e) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

## 2. Define custom exception classes

Define your own exception classes to represent specific error scenarios in your codebase. This allows for more fine-grained error handling and provides meaningful error messages to the users of your code. **Custom exception classes** can also be derived from standard exceptions, such as `std::runtime_error` or `std::logic_error`, to add more semantic meaning to the exceptions thrown.

```cpp
class DatabaseConnectionException : public std::runtime_error {
public:
    DatabaseConnectionException() : std::runtime_error("Failed to connect to the database") {}
};
```

## 3. Report errors consistently

Adhere to a consistent error reporting style across your codebase. This includes consistent use of error types, error messages, and error codes. When reporting errors, provide enough information to help the user of your code understand the cause and context of the error. Consider including relevant details like function names, line numbers, and variable values.

```cpp
void processFile(const std::string& filePath) {
    if (!fileExists(filePath)) {
        std::string errorMessage = "File '" + filePath + "' does not exist";
        throw std::runtime_error(errorMessage);
    }
    // Process the file
}
```

## 4. Handle errors gracefully

When catching exceptions, handle them gracefully and take appropriate actions. This might involve logging the error, notifying the user, or cleaning up any resources used. However, be cautious of swallowing exceptions and ensure meaningful actions are taken based on the type of error encountered.

```cpp
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (const DatabaseConnectionException& e) {
    // Log the error and retry connection
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    // Log the error and handle other exceptions
}
```

## 5. Document error handling behavior

Document the expected error handling behavior of your functions, especially in the public interface. Mention the exceptions that can be thrown, any additional error codes or messages, and whether the function guarantees any strong exception safety guarantees. **Robust documentation is essential for users to understand how to handle errors correctly**.

```cpp
/**
 * Reads data from a file.
 *
 * @param filePath Path to the file
 * @return The data read from the file
 * @throws std::runtime_error if the file does not exist or cannot be read
 */
std::string readFile(const std::string& filePath) {
    // Read the file
}
```

## Conclusion

Following these guidelines can greatly improve the error handling and reporting in your C++ code. By using exceptions for exceptional conditions, defining custom exception classes, reporting errors consistently, handling errors gracefully, and documenting error handling behavior, you can write code that is more reliable, maintainable, and easier to understand.
