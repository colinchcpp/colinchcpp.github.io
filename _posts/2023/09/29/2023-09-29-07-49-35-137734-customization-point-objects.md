**What are customization point objects?**

Customization point objects, also known as extension points or hooks, are designated areas within an application's codebase that are specifically designed to be extended or modified by developers. These points serve as entry points for adding new functionality or overriding existing behavior, without directly modifying the original source code.

**How do customization point objects work?**

Customization point objects typically consist of interfaces, abstract classes, or specialized methods that define the contract or behavior that can be altered by user extensions. By adhering to these contracts, developers can provide their own implementation or behavior at these specific points.

Here's an example in Python:

```python
# Customization Point Interface
class CustomizationPoint:
    def do_custom_action(self):
        pass

# Original Implementation
class OriginalImplementation(CustomizationPoint):
    def do_custom_action(self):
        print("Performing original action...")

# User Extension
class UserExtension(CustomizationPoint):
    def do_custom_action(self):
        print("Performing custom action...")

# Usage
def perform_action(obj: CustomizationPoint):
    obj.do_custom_action()

perform_action(OriginalImplementation())  # Output: Performing original action...
perform_action(UserExtension())  # Output: Performing custom action...
```

In this example, the `CustomizationPoint` interface acts as the customization point object. Both the `OriginalImplementation` and `UserExtension` classes implement this interface and provide their own implementation of the `do_custom_action()` method. By passing different instances to the `perform_action()` function, we observe different outputs.

**Benefits of customization point objects**

1. **Modularity**: Customization points promote a modular architecture, allowing developers to add or swap out functionality as needed, without affecting the core code.
2. **Maintainability**: By separating customizations into dedicated points, it becomes easier to manage and maintain the codebase, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
3. **Reuse**: Customization points enable the reuse of existing code and logic, as developers can build upon and extend the original implementation.
4. **Flexibility**: Customization points empower end-users or third-party developers to tailor the application to their specific requirements, enhancing overall usability and satisfaction.
