To enable return type deduction for lambdas, simply omit the return type declaration when defining the lambda. Here's an example:

```cpp
auto add = [](int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
};
```

In this example, the `add` lambda function takes two `int` parameters and returns their sum using the `+` operator. The return type of the `add` lambda function is deduced as `int` because the return statement inside the lambda body returns an `int`.

Return type deduction for lambdas becomes especially useful when dealing with more complex types:

```cpp
auto getPersonName = [](const Person& person) {
    return person.getName();
};
```

In this example, the `getPersonName` lambda function takes a `const Person&` parameter and returns the name of the person. The return type of the `getPersonName` lambda function is deduced as `std::string` because the `getName()` method of the `person` object returns a `std::string`.

Return type deduction for lambdas can also be combined with other C++ features like `constexpr`, `noexcept`, and template parameters. This allows for even greater flexibility and readability in code.

However, it's important to keep in mind that return type deduction for lambdas has certain limitations. It may not work as expected in some scenarios, such as when the lambda function has multiple return statements with different types. In such cases, it's recommended to explicitly specify the return type using the trailing return type syntax (`-> type`) or by using a helper function.

Overall, the support for deducing return types for lambdas in C++14 simplifies the code and makes it more concise, while still providing type safety and clarity. It's a powerful feature that can greatly enhance the readability and maintainability of C++ code.
