1. `id` attribute
The `id` attribute allows you to give a unique identifier to an HTML element. This can be useful when you want to target specific elements for styling or manipulation using CSS or JavaScript. You can assign a unique ID to an element using the following syntax:
```html
<p id="my-paragraph">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

2. `class` attribute
The `class` attribute allows you to assign one or more class names to an HTML element. This is useful when you want to apply common styles or functionality to a group of elements. You can assign a class to an element using the following syntax:
```html
<p class="highlight">This paragraph has a class.</p>
```

3. `style` attribute
The `style` attribute allows you to apply inline styles directly to an HTML element. This is useful when you want to override or add specific styles to an element. The styles are written in CSS syntax within the attribute value. Here's an example:
```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This paragraph has inline styles.</p>
```

4. `title` attribute
The `title` attribute provides additional information about an element. When you hover over an element with a `title` attribute, a tooltip will appear displaying the text provided within the attribute value. This attribute is commonly used for interactive elements or elements with longer content. Here's an example:
```html
<button title="Click me to submit">Submit</button>
```

These are just a few examples of standard attributes that you can use in HTML to enhance your elements. By utilizing these attributes effectively, you can make your webpages more accessible, maintainable, and interactive.
