Sorting is a fundamental operation in programming, and the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides various sorting algorithms, such as `std::sort()`, which can sort most data types. However, when it comes to custom sorting of complex objects or data structures, we may need to define our own sorting criteria.

In this blog post, we will explore how to perform custom sorting using literals in C++. We will cover the steps required to define a custom sorting function and how to use it with the STL sorting algorithms.

## Defining a Custom Sorting Function

To perform custom sorting, we need to define our own comparison function that will be used by the sorting algorithm. The comparison function determines the order in which elements will be sorted, based on the provided criteria.

The comparison function takes two arguments (elements to be compared) and returns `true` if the first element should be placed before the second element, and `false` otherwise. The function should follow this signature:

```cpp
bool compare(const T& a, const T& b);
```

Here, `T` represents the data type of the elements to be sorted.

## Using Custom Sorting Function with STL Algorithms

Once we have defined our custom comparison function, we can apply it using the STL sorting algorithms, such as `std::sort()`. We need to pass our comparison function as the third argument to the sorting algorithm.

For example, to sort a vector of integers `numbers` using our custom comparison function `compare`, we can use the following code:

```cpp
std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), compare);
```

The `std::sort()` function will use our comparison function to determine the order in which the elements should be sorted.

## Example Implementation

Let's consider an example where we have a custom class called `Employee`, with attributes `name`, `age`, and `salary`. We want to sort a vector of `Employee` objects based on their salary in descending order. We can define our comparison function as follows:

```cpp
bool compare(const Employee& a, const Employee& b) {
    return a.salary > b.salary;
}
```

We can then use this comparison function with the `std::sort()` algorithm to sort the vector of `Employee` objects:

```cpp
std::sort(employees.begin(), employees.end(), compare);
```

In this example, the vector `employees` will be sorted in descending order based on the `salary` attribute of each `Employee` object.

## Conclusion

Custom sorting allows us to define our own criteria for sorting complex objects or data structures. By defining a custom comparison function, we can use it with the STL sorting algorithms to achieve the desired sorting order.

In this blog post, we explored the steps required to define a custom sorting function and how to use it with STL algorithms. We also provided an example implementation to illustrate the process.

Custom sorting provides flexibility and allows us to tailor the sorting operation to our specific needs.
