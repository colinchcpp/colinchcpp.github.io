Sorting is a fundamental operation in programming that allows us to arrange elements in a specific order. By default, most programming languages have built-in sorting functions that work well for a wide range of scenarios. However, there may be cases where we need to sort elements in a custom order that is not supported by the default sorting algorithm. 

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement custom sorting literals in C++. Custom sorting literals allow us to define our own rules for sorting elements based on specific criteria, providing us with more flexibility and control over the sorting process.

## Understanding Sorting in C++

In C++, sorting is typically performed using the `std::sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header. The `std::sort` function sorts elements in ascending order by default, but it can also be customized to sort in descending order or based on a custom sorting function.

For example, consider an array of integers that we want to sort in descending order:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

bool compare(int a, int b) {
  return a > b;
}

int main() {
  std::vector<int> numbers = {5, 2, 8, 1, 9};

  std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), compare);

  for (int number : numbers) {
    std::cout << number << " ";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this code snippet, we define a custom comparison function `compare` that sorts integers in descending order. We pass this function as the third argument to `std::sort` to customize the sorting order.

## Implementing Custom Sorting Literals

To implement custom sorting literals in C++, we can define a custom class or struct that overloads the less-than (`<`) operator. This allows us to define the custom sorting rules based on the desired criteria.

Let's consider a scenario where we have a collection of objects representing students. We want to sort the students based on their names, but we want the sorting to be case-insensitive. Here's how we can implement this custom sorting literal:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

struct Student {
  std::string name;
  int age;
};

bool operator<(const Student& lhs, const Student& rhs) {
  std::string name1 = lhs.name;
  std::string name2 = rhs.name;

  // Convert names to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
  std::transform(name1.begin(), name1.end(), name1.begin(), ::tolower);
  std::transform(name2.begin(), name2.end(), name2.begin(), ::tolower);

  return name1 < name2;
}

int main() {
  std::vector<Student> students = {
      {"Alice", 20},
      {"bob", 19},
      {"Charles", 21},
      {"david", 18},
  };

  std::sort(students.begin(), students.end());

  for (const Student& student : students) {
    std::cout << student.name << " (age: " << student.age << ")" << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this code snippet, we define a custom `operator<` in the `Student` struct. This operator converts the names to lowercase before performing the comparison. By overloading the `<` operator, we specify that the objects should be sorted based on their names with case-insensitive comparison.

## Conclusion

Custom sorting literals provide us with the ability to define our own rules for sorting elements based on specific criteria. In C++, we can implement custom sorting literals by overloading the less-than (`<`) operator in a custom class or struct. This allows us to customize the sorting process, enabling us to meet our specific requirements.

By customizing the sorting process, we can sort elements in a way that is not supported by the default sorting algorithms, which gives us greater control and flexibility in our programs.
