Sorting is a fundamental operation in programming, and programming languages provide various ways to sort data. In C++, the `std::sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header is commonly used for sorting. By default, `std::sort` uses the `<` operator for comparison, which works well for numeric and string types. However, sorting custom types or user-defined literals often requires a custom comparison function or operator overloading.

In this blog post, we will explore how to perform custom sorting with custom literals in C++. We will demonstrate how to define a custom comparison function for sorting custom types and how to use it with `std::sort`.

## Defining Custom Comparison Function

To perform custom sorting with custom literals, we first need to define a comparison function that specifies the desired sorting order. The comparison function should return `true` if the first argument should come before the second argument, and `false` otherwise.

Let's say we have a custom type called `Person` with two properties: `name` and `age`. To sort a vector of `Person` objects in ascending order of their ages, we can define a comparison function as follows:

```cpp
bool compareByAge(const Person& p1, const Person& p2) {
    return p1.age < p2.age;
}
```

In this example, the comparison function compares `Person` objects based on their `age` property.

## Using Custom Comparison Function with std::sort

Now that we have our custom comparison function defined, we can use it with `std::sort` to sort our custom objects.

```cpp
{% raw %}
std::vector<Person> people = {{"John", 25}, {"Alice", 30}, {"Bob", 20}};

std::sort(people.begin(), people.end(), compareByAge);
{% endraw %}
```

In this example, we have a vector of `Person` objects, and we pass the `compareByAge` comparison function as the third argument to `std::sort`. This tells `std::sort` to use our custom comparison function for sorting the `people` vector.

The resulting vector will be sorted in ascending order of the `age` property.

## Conclusion

Custom sorting with custom literals in C++ requires defining a custom comparison function and using it with `std::sort`. By leveraging custom comparison functions, we can sort custom types based on specific criteria.

By providing a way to customize the sorting behavior, C++ empowers programmers to sort data in a way that best suits their needs.

Remember to use meaningful comparison logic in your custom comparison functions for accurate and efficient sorting of custom types!
