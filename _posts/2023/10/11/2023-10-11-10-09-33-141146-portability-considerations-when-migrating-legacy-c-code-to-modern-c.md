Migrating legacy C++ code to modern C++ can bring many benefits such as improved performance, cleaner code, and better support for new language features. However, one important aspect to consider during the migration process is portability. Ensuring that the code can run smoothly on different platforms and architectures is crucial. In this blog post, we will look at some key considerations to keep in mind when migrating legacy C++ code to modern C++ with portability in focus.

## 1. Compiler and Language Standards

One of the first things to consider is the choice of compiler and the language standard to use for the modern C++ code. Different compilers may have variations in their implementations and support for certain language features. It is important to choose a compiler that supports the desired level of portability and compliance with the C++ standards.

Using the latest C++ standard is recommended, as it offers new language features and improvements. However, it is crucial to ensure that all the target platforms and compilers support the chosen standard. It's a good practice to consult the documentation of the compilers and platforms to determine the level of support for the specific language features you plan to use.

## 2. Platform-Specific Code

In legacy C++ code, there may be platform-specific code that needs to be modified to ensure portability. This includes code that directly interacts with the underlying operating system, hardware, or specific libraries.

To make the code portable, it may be necessary to refactor platform-specific code into separate modules or encapsulate it with conditional compilation directives (`#ifdef` or `#if`) based on the target platform. By isolating the platform-specific code, it becomes easier to maintain and adapt for different platforms during the migration process.

## 3. Dependencies and Libraries

Another key consideration is the dependencies and libraries used in the legacy C++ code. Some libraries may have platform-specific implementations or rely on deprecated features. It is important to evaluate the compatibility of these dependencies with the target platforms and find suitable alternatives if necessary.

When migrating to modern C++, it is also worth considering adopting cross-platform libraries and frameworks that provide a unified API for different platforms. These libraries can help in achieving better portability by abstracting away platform-specific details and offering consistent functionality across platforms.

## 4. Testing

Ensuring the portability of the migrated code requires rigorous testing on different platforms. Set up an automated testing infrastructure that covers various platforms, compilers, and architectures to detect any issues related to portability.

Unit tests, integration tests, and system-level tests should be performed to verify that the code works correctly and behaves consistently across different platforms. Continuous integration systems can be helpful in automatically running tests on multiple configurations to catch any portability issues early in the development process.

## Conclusion

Migrating legacy C++ code to modern C++ can offer numerous advantages, but it is essential to consider portability during the migration process. By carefully selecting the compiler and language standards, refactoring platform-specific code, evaluating dependencies, and performing thorough testing, you can ensure that the code runs smoothly on different platforms and architectures.

Remember, portability is not a one-time effort but an ongoing consideration. Regularly monitor updates from compilers, libraries, and platforms to stay up-to-date with the latest changes that may impact code portability.
