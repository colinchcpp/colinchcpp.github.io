In today's rapidly evolving technology landscape, it is crucial for companies to keep their software up-to-date. When it comes to legacy C++ codebases, migrating to modern build and deployment techniques can greatly improve development efficiency, streamline processes, and enhance software quality.

This blog post will explore some steps to incorporate modern build and deployment techniques after migrating from legacy C++ code. We will focus on the following areas:

1. [Implementing a Build System](#implementing-a-build-system)
2. [Adopting Continuous Integration and Deployment](#adopting-continuous-integration-and-deployment)
3. [Containerization with Docker](#containerization-with-docker)
4. [Automated Testing](#automated-testing)
5. [Release and Version Management](#release-and-version-management)
6. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

Let's get started!

## Implementing a Build System

A build system is an essential component for modern software development. It provides a standardized and repeatable way to compile, build, and package your software. Popular build systems for C++ include **CMake** and **Make**.

When migrating from legacy code, you may need to refactor your build scripts or configuration files to align with the chosen build system. By doing so, you ensure consistent and efficient builds across different platforms and environments.

## Adopting Continuous Integration and Deployment

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices have revolutionized software development by providing automation, early feedback, and faster release cycles.

Integrating CI and CD tools into your build pipeline can significantly enhance your development process. Utilize popular CI/CD tools like **Jenkins**, **Travis CI**, or **CircleCI** to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying your code.

By configuring triggers on your repositories, you can automatically initiate builds whenever changes are pushed to your repository, enabling faster feedback and reducing integration issues.

## Containerization with Docker

Containerization has gained significant popularity as a modern deployment technique. Docker, an industry-standard containerization platform, allows you to package your application along with all its dependencies into a portable container.

By containerizing your C++ application, you achieve greater portability, scalability, and isolation. This enables smooth deployment across different environments, simplifies dependency management, and ensures a consistent runtime experience.

## Automated Testing

Testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and stability of your software. Implementing automated tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, and system tests, is essential to catch bugs early and reduce regression issues.

Modern testing frameworks like **Google Test** and **Catch2** provide robust functionalities for writing and running tests. Integrate these frameworks into your build pipeline to automate the execution of tests during the development and deployment phases.

## Release and Version Management

Managing releases and versioning of your software is a vital aspect of software development. By adopting modern version control systems like **Git**, you can easily manage different versions of your codebase, track changes, and collaborate with other developers more effectively.

Use semantic versioning to clearly communicate the impact and changes introduced with each release. Additionally, leverage features provided by Git, such as branching and tagging, to manage parallel development efforts and create stable release candidates.

## Conclusion

Migrating from a legacy C++ codebase to modern build and deployment techniques is a significant undertaking, but the benefits are worth it. Incorporating a modern build system, adopting CI/CD practices, containerizing your application with Docker, implementing automated testing, and effectively managing releases and versions will elevate your development process to new heights.

By embracing these modern approaches, your development team can enjoy increased productivity, reduced time to market, and improved software quality. Keep evolving and stay ahead in the ever-changing software development landscape!
