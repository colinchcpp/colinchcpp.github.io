When migrating legacy code to a modern C++ codebase, it is a good opportunity to update the coding and naming conventions to align with current best practices. Adhering to modern conventions can improve code readability, maintainability, and make it easier for new developers to understand and contribute to the codebase. In this blog post, we will explore some important coding and naming conventions to consider when modernizing your C++ code.

### Use Descriptive and Meaningful Names
One of the most crucial aspects of writing clean code is to use descriptive and meaningful variable and function names. By choosing meaningful names, you can improve the readability of your code and make it easier to understand the purpose and functionality of each component.

### Follow the Naming Conventions
C++ follows a set of naming conventions that have evolved over the years. It is important to familiarize yourself with these conventions to ensure consistency in your codebase. Some common conventions include:
- Class names should be in **PascalCase**.
- Member variables and functions should be in **camelCase**.
- Global variables should be avoided, but if used, should be in **snake_case**.

### Use CamelCase for Variables and Functions
CamelCase is a widely used convention in many modern programming languages, including C++. It involves writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with an uppercase letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation. By using CamelCase for your variables and functions, you adhere to the standard coding style and make your code more readable.

### Avoid Hungarian Notation
Hungarian notation is an outdated naming convention that prefixes variables with a type code to indicate their data type. However, modern C++ compilers are capable of enforcing type safety, which makes Hungarian notation redundant and unnecessary. Therefore, consider avoiding Hungarian notation in your migrated codebase.

### Consider Using Namespaces
Namespaces provide a way to group related code and prevent naming conflicts. When modernizing your C++ code, consider using namespaces to organize your classes, functions, and variables. Namespaces can improve code clarity and prevent naming clashes, especially in large codebases.

### Use Auto Type Inference
The introduction of `auto` in modern C++ allows for type inference, where the compiler automatically determines the appropriate data type of a variable. Leveraging `auto` whenever possible can improve code readability and reduce the verbosity of variable declarations.

### Avoid Using Macros
Although macros can be powerful in certain situations, they should generally be avoided in modern C++ codebases. Macros can lead to code maintenance issues, as they lack type safety and can cause unexpected side effects. Instead, prefer using constants or inline functions for compile-time constants or simple operations.

## Conclusion
When migrating legacy C++ code to a modern codebase, updating coding and naming conventions is an essential step. By incorporating modern practices, such as using descriptive and meaningful names, following naming conventions, and leveraging features like namespaces and auto type inference, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your codebase. Additionally, avoiding Hungarian notation and limiting the use of macros can help ensure cleaner and more maintainable code. Remember, adhering to modern conventions not only benefits the current development team but also makes it easier for future developers to understand and contribute to the codebase.
