## Planning and Goal Setting

Before starting the migration process, it is essential to have a well-defined plan and clear goals.

## Establishing Clear Roles and Responsibilities

During the migration process, it is crucial to establish clear roles and responsibilities for each team member. This ensures that everyone knows their tasks and is accountable for their part in the migration. Clearly defined roles help to avoid confusion, duplication of efforts, and potential bottlenecks. It is also important to communicate any changes or updates to the roles and responsibilities as the migration progresses.

Creating an inclusive and open environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas fosters innovation and helps to improve the overall outcome of the migration.
