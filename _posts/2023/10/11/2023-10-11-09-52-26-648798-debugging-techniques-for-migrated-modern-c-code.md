Migrating legacy code to modern C++ can be a challenging task. Once the migration is complete, it's essential to ensure that the migrated code behaves as expected and any issues are promptly addressed. In this blog post, we will explore some useful debugging techniques specifically tailored for debugging migrated modern C++ code.

## Introduction

Migrating legacy C++ code often involves making significant changes, including upgrading to modern C++ standards, introducing new libraries, and refactoring. These changes can introduce new bugs and issues that may not be immediately apparent. To effectively debug the migrated code, consider the following techniques.

## Compile with Debug Symbols

Debug symbols provide valuable information during the debugging process. When compiling the code, ensure that the `-g` flag is used to include debug symbols. These symbols enable the debugger to map machine code back to the original source code, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

```cpp
g++ -g main.cpp -o my_program
```

## Enable Warnings and Treat Warnings as Errors

Modern compilers often come with a rich set of warning flags. Enable as many warnings as possible by using `-Werror` to treat warnings as errors. This ensures that any potential issues are reported during the compilation process, allowing you to catch them early.

```cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.cpp -o my_program
```

## Use a Modern Debugger

Utilize modern debuggers that provide advanced features to aid in the debugging process. Some popular debuggers for C++ include Visual Studio Code with the C++ extension, GDB, or LLDB. These tools offer features such as breakpoints, stepping through code, inspecting variables, and examining the call stack.

## Add Diagnostic Messages

Strategically add diagnostic messages throughout the migrated code to provide insights during the debugging process. Use `std::cout` or logging libraries, such as Boost.Log or spdlog, to print relevant information such as variable values, function calls, or program flow. This allows you to trace and understand the code execution, making it easier to identify the root cause of issues.

```cpp
std::cout << "Variable x = " << x << std::endl;
```

## Test in Isolation

When debugging migrated code, it's beneficial to isolate specific components or modules for testing. By testing the code in isolation, you can narrow down potential causes of issues and focus debugging efforts on specific areas of the codebase. Unit tests can help catch bugs early and ensure that individual components function correctly.

## Use Code Review and Pair Programming

Leverage the power of code review and pair programming. Collaborating with team members can provide fresh perspectives and insights into potential issues. Code reviews allow for spotting mistakes, identifying code smells, and suggesting improvements, while pair programming facilitates real-time problem-solving and knowledge-sharing.

## Conclusion

Debugging migrated modern C++ code requires a systematic and meticulous approach. By compiling with debug symbols, enabling warnings, and leveraging modern debuggers, you'll have powerful tools at your disposal to identify and fix issues. Additionally, adding diagnostic messages, testing in isolation, and seeking collaboration through code review and pair programming can greatly enhance the debugging process. Successfully debugging migrated code ensures the stability and reliability of your modern C++ application.
