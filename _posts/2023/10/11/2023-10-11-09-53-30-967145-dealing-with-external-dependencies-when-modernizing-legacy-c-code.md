Modernizing legacy C++ code can be a challenging task, especially when it comes to dealing with external dependencies. Legacy projects often rely on outdated libraries or have custom-written code that may not be compatible with newer versions of those dependencies.

In this blog post, we will discuss some strategies and best practices for managing and updating external dependencies when modernizing legacy C++ code.

## Identify Outdated Dependencies

Before proceeding with any updates, it is crucial to identify which external dependencies are outdated and no longer actively maintained. This can be done by researching the project documentation, checking online forums, or reaching out to the respective library's community.

Once you have identified the outdated dependencies, you can plan the migration process accordingly.

## Gradual Migration

Instead of updating all the external dependencies at once, it is often more practical to adopt a gradual migration approach. This involves updating one dependency at a time, verifying that the code still functions correctly after each update.

By taking this approach, you can isolate any issues that arise from dependency updates and address them individually, minimizing the impact on the overall codebase.

## Wrapping Legacy Code

In some cases, the outdated external dependencies may be tightly integrated into the legacy codebase, making it difficult to update them directly. In such situations, wrapping the legacy code with new abstraction layers can be an effective solution.

By creating wrapper functions or classes around the legacy code, you can encapsulate the interactions with the outdated dependencies. This allows you to update the dependency on the wrapper layer without affecting the rest of the codebase. Additionally, it makes the code more maintainable and easier to update in the future.

## Automate Dependency Updates

Keeping dependencies up to date is an ongoing process. To simplify this task and minimize the risk of introducing errors, consider automating the dependency update process.

There are various tools available, such as package managers and build systems, that can automatically fetch the latest versions of dependencies and update them in your project. By using these tools, you can ensure that your project is always using the most recent and secure versions of external libraries.

## Conclusion

Upgrading external dependencies is an essential part of modernizing legacy C++ code. By following the strategies mentioned above, you can effectively manage external dependencies and avoid potential pitfalls during the migration process.

Remember to carefully identify outdated dependencies, adopt a gradual migration approach, wrap legacy code where necessary, and leverage automation tools to streamline dependency updates.

By taking a systematic and cautious approach, you can successfully modernize your legacy C++ codebase and ensure its longevity in the rapidly evolving software landscape.
