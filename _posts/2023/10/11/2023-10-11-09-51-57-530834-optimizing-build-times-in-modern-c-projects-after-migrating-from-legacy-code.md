## Introduction

Migrating from legacy C++ code to modern C++ brings many benefits, such as improved code maintainability, enhanced features, and better performance. However, one challenge developers often face when migrating is the increase in build times. This article will discuss some strategies to optimize build times in modern C++ projects after migrating from legacy code.

## 1. Use Precompiled Headers (PCH)

Precompiled Headers (PCH) can significantly reduce build times by precompiling header files and reusing them across multiple translation units. By including commonly used headers in a precompiled header, the compiler doesn't need to parse and compile them repeatedly, resulting in faster compilation.

To use PCH, create a header file (e.g., "stdafx.h") containing commonly used headers and enable precompiled header support in your build system or IDE. By having a carefully crafted set of headers in the PCH, you can minimize rebuild times and speed up the build process.

Example code:

```cpp
// stdafx.h
#pragma once

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
// ... other commonly used headers
```

## 2. Compiler Options

Compiler options play a crucial role in build time optimization. Here are a few options you can consider:

- **Enable incremental build**: Some build systems allow incremental builds, where only modified source files and their dependencies are recompiled. This can significantly reduce build times when making small changes.

- **Optimize the build system**: Ensure that your build system is correctly configured for your project. Avoid unnecessary recompilations by correctly specifying dependencies and leveraging build caching mechanisms.

- **Tune optimization levels**: Balancing compilation speed and generated code quality is essential. Experiment with different optimization levels (-O0, -O1, -O2, or -O3) to find the optimal trade-off for your project. Higher optimization levels might provide faster code execution but can increase build times.

## 3. Leverage Module System or Precompiled Modules (C++20)

C++20 introduces modules, a new way to organize and encapsulate code units. Modules can provide better build-time performance by allowing the use of precompiled modules. Instead of parsing and compiling headers for every translation unit, modules are precompiled and their interface is used directly during the build process.

To leverage modules, use the `import` statement to import the required modules instead of including headers. By using modules, you can reduce redundant parsing and speed up build times.

Example code:

```cpp
import <iostream>;
import <vector>;
import <string>;
// ... other required modules
```

## 4. Refactor Large Header Files

Large header files can significantly impact build times, especially when included in multiple translation units. Consider refactoring such files and breaking them into smaller, more focused headers. This helps reduce the compilation time spent on unnecessary code and improves build times.

Additionally, evaluate the inclusion of headers in source files. Only include necessary headers to minimize dependencies and compilation time.

## 5. Parallelize Builds

Build systems often provide options to parallelize the build process, allowing multiple translation units to be compiled simultaneously. This can significantly reduce build times by utilizing the available CPU cores efficiently.

Check the documentation of your build system or compiler to enable parallel compilation. Experiment with different levels of parallelization to find the optimal setting for your hardware configuration and project size.

## Conclusion

Optimizing build times in modern C++ projects after migrating from legacy code is crucial for maintaining developer productivity. By implementing strategies such as using precompiled headers, optimizing compiler options, leveraging modules or precompiled modules, refactoring large header files, and parallelizing builds, you can significantly reduce build times and improve your development workflow.

Remember to regularly profile and measure the build times to ensure the applied optimizations are effective. Happy coding!
