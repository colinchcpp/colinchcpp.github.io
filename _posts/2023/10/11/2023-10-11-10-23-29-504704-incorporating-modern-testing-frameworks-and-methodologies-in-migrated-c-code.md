When migrating legacy C++ code to a modern platform, it's crucial to ensure that the code continues to function as intended. One of the best ways to achieve this is by incorporating modern testing frameworks and methodologies into the testing process. In this blog post, we'll explore how to effectively test migrated C++ code using some popular testing frameworks and methodologies.

## Introduction
Migrating legacy C++ code to a modern platform introduces potential risks and challenges. It's crucial to have a robust testing strategy in place to catch any regressions that may have been introduced during the migration process. 

## 1. Automated Testing
Automated testing is a key component of the modern testing approach. It involves running test cases automatically, allowing for early detection of issues and reducing the effort required for manual testing. There are several popular C++ testing frameworks available that can aid in implementing automated testing, such as:
- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest): A widely used testing framework that provides powerful and flexible features for writing and running test cases.
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2): A lightweight, header-only testing framework that simplifies the process of writing and executing tests.

## 2. Unit Testing
Unit testing focuses on testing individual units of code in isolation. By writing unit tests, you can verify that each unit behaves as intended and takes care of edge cases. With frameworks like Google Test and Catch2, writing unit tests in C++ becomes straightforward. Here's an example of a unit test using Google Test:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple function to be tested
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// The unit test for the add function
TEST(AddTest, PositiveNumbers) {
    EXPECT_EQ(add(2, 3), 5);
    EXPECT_EQ(add(-2, 3), 1);
    EXPECT_EQ(add(0, 0), 0);
}

// Run all the tests
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

## 3. Integration Testing
Integration testing ensures that multiple components of the system work together correctly. It involves testing the interaction between different units to catch any issues that may arise due to their integration. In C++, you can use the same testing frameworks mentioned above to write integration tests as well.

## 4. Mocking
Mocking is a technique used to isolate the code being tested from its dependencies. It allows you to replace external dependencies with mock objects, enabling you to control the behavior of those dependencies during testing. While there are several C++ mocking frameworks available, a popular choice is [Google Mock](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/master/googlemock).

## 5. Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) is an important aspect of modern software development practices. By implementing a CI process, you can ensure that your code is built, tested, and integrated continuously. Popular CI platforms like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) can be used to automate the build and test processes for your migrated C++ code.

## Conclusion
Incorporating modern testing frameworks and methodologies into your migrated C++ code is crucial to ensure its correctness and stability. Automated testing, unit testing, integration testing, mocking, and continuous integration are all valuable practices to adopt during the testing process. By following these best practices, you can confidently migrate your C++ code to a modern platform while maintaining high-quality and reliable software.
