In recent years, containerization has become a popular approach for deploying and managing applications. It offers a lightweight and isolated execution environment, making it easier to package and deploy applications consistently across different environments. While containerization is commonly associated with web applications and microservices, it can also be beneficial for C++ applications. In this blog post, we will explore some containerization strategies specifically tailored for C++ applications.

## 1. Building a Docker Image

Docker is one of the most popular containerization platforms available today, and it provides an excellent option for containerizing C++ applications. The first step is to create a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains a series of instructions to build a Docker image. Here's a basic example:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y g++ cmake

# Copy source code
COPY . /app

# Build the application
WORKDIR /app
RUN cmake . && make

# Set the entry point for the container
CMD ["./my_cpp_app"]
```

In this example, we start from a base Ubuntu image, install the necessary dependencies (e.g., g++ and cmake), copy the C++ source code into the container, build the application using CMake, and finally, set the entry point command to run the application.

## 2. Using Build Systems

Another approach for containerizing C++ applications is to leverage build systems that support containerization. CMake and Bazel are two popular build systems that provide native support for building and packaging applications as container images.

### CMake:

CMake, a widely used build system in the C++ community, allows you to define build targets that generate container images. You can use the `add_custom_target` command along with the `add_custom_command` command to run Docker commands during the build process. Here's an example:

```cmake
add_custom_target(
    my_cpp_container
    COMMAND docker build -t my_cpp_app .
    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
)
```

In this example, we create a custom target called `my_cpp_container` that runs the `docker build` command to build a Docker image with the tag `my_cpp_app`. You can trigger this target using `cmake --build . --target my_cpp_container`.

### Bazel:

Bazel, another popular build system used for large-scale software projects, also has built-in support for containerization. With Bazel, you can define container rules in your build files to generate container images. Here's an example:

```python
load("@io_bazel_rules_docker//docker:docker.bzl", "docker_build")

docker_build(
    name = "my_cpp_app_image",
    base = "@ubuntu:latest",
    tags = ["my_cpp_app"],
    workspace_status_command = ":status",
    files = [
        "//path/to/source:main.cpp"
    ],
)
```

In this example, we define a `docker_build` rule that generates a Docker image with the tag `my_cpp_app`. The `base` attribute specifies the base image to use, and the `files` attribute specifies the C++ source file.

## Conclusion

Containerization provides a range of benefits for C++ applications, including easier deployment, scalability, and portability. By using containerization platforms like Docker or leveraging build systems like CMake or Bazel, you can streamline the packaging and deployment process of your C++ applications. With these containerization strategies, you can ensure that your C++ applications are consistent and reproducible across different environments.
