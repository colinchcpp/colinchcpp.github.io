Graph algorithms play a crucial role in various domains such as social networks, recommendation systems, and route planning. As graphs grow in size and complexity, it becomes essential to process them efficiently. One way to achieve this is by leveraging parallel processing techniques to perform graph computations in parallel.

In modern C++, the `<thread>` library provides a straightforward way to work with threads. However, with C++20, the `<thread>` library has been enhanced with the introduction of the `std::jthread` class, which simplifies the management of threads and ensures proper cleanup.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use `std::jthread` to implement parallel graph algorithms. But before we dive into the implementation, let's have a brief overview of `std::jthread`.

## What is `std::jthread`?

`std::jthread` is a new addition to C++20 that represents a joinable thread. It combines the functionality of `std::thread` and `std::stop_source` into a single class, making it easier to work with threads.

Unlike `std::thread`, which requires manual management of thread termination and cleanup, `std::jthread` automatically detaches or joins the underlying thread upon destruction. Additionally, it provides a cancelation mechanism through the associated `std::stop_source`.

Now that we understand the basics of `std::jthread`, let's see how we can use it to implement parallel graph algorithms.

## Parallel Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms deal with navigating and processing elements in a graph, such as finding the shortest path or identifying connected components. Typically, these algorithms involve traversing the graph and performing computations on individual vertices or edges.

To parallelize graph algorithms, one approach is to divide the work among multiple threads and process different parts of the graph simultaneously. This can significantly improve the performance for large graphs.

Here's an example of how to implement a parallel graph algorithm for finding the shortest path using `std::jthread`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <atomic>

// Graph representation (adjacency list)
std::vector<std::vector<int>> graph;

// Shared data
std::vector<int> distances;
std::atomic_bool done(false);

void shortestPathParallel(int source) {
    distances[source] = 0;

    std::queue<int> q;
    q.push(source);

    while (!q.empty() && !done) {
        int current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (int neighbor : graph[current]) {
            if (distances[neighbor] == -1) {
                distances[neighbor] = distances[current] + 1;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Initialize the graph and distances vector

    // Determine the number of threads
    unsigned int numThreads = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();

    // Create a vector of jthreads
    std::vector<std::jthread> threads;

    // Divide the work and spawn threads
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
        threads.emplace_back([&]() {
            while (!done) {
                int currentVertex = getNextVertex();

                if (currentVertex >= 0) {
                    shortestPathParallel(currentVertex);
                } else {
                    done = true;
                }
            }
        });
    }

    // Wait for all threads to finish
    for (std::jthread& thread : threads) {
        thread.join();
    }

    // Process the results

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create a vector of `std::jthread` objects, where each thread executes the `shortestPathParallel` function. The algorithm utilizes a shared data structure to store distances from the source vertex to each vertex in the graph. The algorithm terminates when there are no more vertices to process or when the global flag `done` is set to true.

By dividing the work among multiple threads, we can process different parts of the graph concurrently, improving the overall execution time of the shortest path algorithm.

# Conclusion

With the introduction of `std::jthread` in C++20, parallelizing graph algorithms has become even more accessible. By leveraging the power of parallel processing, we can achieve significant performance improvements for processing large graphs.

In this blog post, we explored how to use `std::jthread` to implement parallel graph algorithms. We learned about the benefits of using `std::jthread` over `std::thread` and saw an example of parallelizing the shortest path algorithm.
