When working with multithreaded applications in C++, the `std::jthread` class provided by the C++20 standard library is a valuable tool. It is designed to simplify thread management and is an improvement over the traditional `std::thread` class. However, like any library feature, `std::jthread` is not immune to issues.

In this blog post, we will explore some common issues that may arise when using `std::jthread` and discuss ways to debug and resolve them.

## 1. Joining a detached jthread #(debugging, stdjthread)

One of the common mistakes is trying to join a detached `std::jthread`. A detached `std::jthread` doesn't require an explicit join, and attempting to do so can lead to undefined behavior. Therefore, it is important to ensure that you only call `join()` or `detach()` on a joinable thread.

```cpp
std::jthread thread([](){
   // Thread work...
});

// Attempting to join a detached jthread!
thread.join(); // Incorrect!
```

To avoid this issue, you can use the `if` statement to check if the thread is joinable before calling `join()`:

```cpp
std::jthread thread([](){
   // Thread work...
});

if (thread.joinable()) {
    thread.join(); // Correct!
}
```

## 2. Destructor throwing an exception #(debugging, stdjthread)

Another issue that may occur is when a destructor throws an exception. If an exception is thrown during the destruction of a `std::jthread` object, `std::terminate()` is called, resulting in a program termination.

To avoid this, it is recommended to catch and handle any exceptions that might be thrown from the destructor. You can use a `try-catch` block to gracefully handle the exception:

```cpp
try {
    std::jthread thread([](){
        // Thread work...
    });
}
catch (const std::exception& ex) {
    // Handle the exception...
}
```

Alternatively, you can use a helper function like `std::uncaught_exceptions()` to check if an exception is pending and perform appropriate cleanup, such as calling `detach()`:

```cpp
std::jthread thread([](){
    // Thread work...
});

if (std::uncaught_exceptions() > 0) {
    thread.detach(); // Detach thread if an exception is pending.
}
```

## Conclusion

Using `std::jthread` can simplify managing threads in C++, but it's important to be aware of potential issues and how to debug them. By avoiding incorrect usage, checking thread joinability, and handling exceptions gracefully, you can enhance the reliability and stability of your multithreaded applications.

Remember to always pay attention to the behavior of the library and refer to the C++20 standard documentation for further details on `std::jthread`.
