One of the exciting new features introduced in C++20 is the `std::jthread` class. It is a new addition to the Standard Library and is designed to simplify thread management in C++. With `std::jthread`, managing threads becomes more convenient and safer compared to the existing `std::thread` class.

## What is `std::jthread`?

`std::jthread` is a thread management class that provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads in C++. It is an improvement over the existing `std::thread` class, offering additional features and safety guarantees.

## Creating a `std::jthread`

Creating a `std::jthread` is as simple as creating an instance of the class. Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void myThreadFunction() {
    // The function executed in the thread
    std::cout << "Hello from thread!\n";
}

int main() {
    std::jthread myThread(myThreadFunction);
    
    // Do other work in the main thread

    myThread.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a function `myThreadFunction()` that will be executed in a separate thread. We then create a `std::jthread` instance `myThread`, passing the function as a parameter. The function will be executed concurrently once the `std::jthread` object is created.

## Handling thread termination

A notable feature of `std::jthread` is that it automatically joins the thread when the `std::jthread` object is destroyed. This eliminates the need to manually call `join()` or `detach()` as you would with `std::thread`. This automatic joining ensures that the thread finishes execution before the `std::jthread` object goes out of scope.

```cpp
void myThreadFunction() {
    // The function executed in the thread
    std::cout << "Hello from thread!\n";
}

int main() {
    {
        std::jthread myThread(myThreadFunction);
    }
    
    // Do other work in the main thread

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the thread started by `myThread` will execute and automatically join when the `std::jthread` object goes out of scope at the closing brace. This guarantees that the thread completes its execution before the program terminates.

## Conclusion

`std::jthread` is a welcome addition to C++20, providing a simpler and safer way to manage threads compared to `std::thread`. With automatic joining and its high-level interface, `std::jthread` makes it easier to write robust multithreaded applications in C++. So, if you're starting a new project or considering migrating to C++20, give `std::jthread` a try!
