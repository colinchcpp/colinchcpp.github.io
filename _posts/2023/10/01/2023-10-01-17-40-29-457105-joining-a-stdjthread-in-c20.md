To join a `std::jthread` and wait for it to finish, you can use the `join()` member function. Here's an example that demonstrates how to join a `std::jthread`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <thread>

void workerThread()
{
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
    std::cout << "Worker thread completed\n";
}

int main()
{
    std::jthread myThread(workerThread); // create a jthread and start executing the workerThread function

    // Do some other work while the thread is running
    std::cout << "Main thread continues...\n";
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));

    // Join the thread and wait for it to finish
    myThread.join();

    std::cout << "Main thread completed\n";

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a `workerThread` function that simply sleeps for 2 seconds and then prints a message. In the `main` function, we create a `std::jthread` called `myThread` and pass the `workerThread` function as the constructor argument. This starts the execution of the `workerThread` in a separate thread.

We then print a message from the main thread indicating that it continues its execution. After waiting for 1 second, we call `myThread.join()` to join the `std::jthread` and wait for it to finish. This means that the main thread will block until `workerThread` completes its execution.

Finally, we print a message from the main thread indicating that it has completed.

Joining a `std::jthread` allows us to synchronize the execution of multiple threads and ensures that the main thread waits for worker threads to finish before the program ends. This can be useful in scenarios where the main thread relies on the results or side effects of the worker thread's computation.
