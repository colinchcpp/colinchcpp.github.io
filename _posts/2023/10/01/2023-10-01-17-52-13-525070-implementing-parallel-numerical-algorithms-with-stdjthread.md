Parallelizing numerical algorithms can greatly improve their performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores or even distributed computing resources. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement parallel numerical algorithms using the `std::jthread` class introduced in C++20. The `std::jthread` class provides a convenient way to create and manage lightweight threads, making it suitable for parallelizing numerical computations.

## What is `std::jthread`?

`std::jthread` is a new addition to the C++ standard library as part of the Concurrency TS. It is an RAII-style thread class that combines the functionality of `std::thread` and `std::joinable`. It allows us to create and manage threads without worrying about explicitly joining or detaching them. When a `std::jthread` object goes out of scope, it automatically joins the associated thread, ensuring proper resource management.

## Parallel Algorithm Design

When parallelizing numerical algorithms, we typically divide the workload among multiple threads to process different portions concurrently. Here are the general steps to design a parallel numerical algorithm using `std::jthread`:

1. **Identify the workload**: Determine the portion of the algorithm that can be executed independently in parallel. This could be a loop iteration, a task, or a data set to process.

2. **Divide the workload**: Split the workload into smaller chunks, assigning each chunk to a thread for parallel processing. The number of chunks is usually based on the available resources, such as the number of CPU cores.

3. **Create threads**: Create a `std::jthread` object for each chunk of the workload, specifying the function or lambda expression to execute in parallel.

4. **Perform computation**: Each thread executes its assigned portion of the workload concurrently. This can be done using `std::async`, `std::thread`, or other parallel execution mechanisms.

5. **Synchronize threads**: If necessary, synchronize the threads to ensure correct results. This can be achieved using synchronization primitives like mutex or atomic operations.

6. **Combine results**: Merge the results obtained from each thread back into the final result. This step might involve reduction or aggregation of data.

## Example: Parallel Sum Calculation

Let's consider a simple example of calculating the sum of a large array using parallel computation. We will divide the array into smaller chunks and assign each chunk to a separate thread for parallel summation. Here's an example code snippet:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <thread>

constexpr int numThreads = 4;

int parallelSum(const std::vector<int>& data) {
    std::vector<std::jthread> threads;
    std::vector<int> partialSums(numThreads);

    // Divide the workload
    const int chunkSize = data.size() / numThreads;
    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
        const int start = i * chunkSize;
        const int end = (i + 1) * chunkSize;

        // Create threads
        threads.emplace_back([&data, start, end, &partialSums, i]() {
            partialSums[i] = std::accumulate(data.begin() + start, data.begin() + end, 0);
        });
    }

    // Wait for all threads to finish
    for (auto& thread : threads) {
        thread.join();
    }

    // Combine partial sums
    return std::accumulate(partialSums.begin(), partialSums.end(), 0);
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data(1000000, 1); // Create a large array

    // Calculate sum using parallel computation
    int sum = parallelSum(data);

    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we divide the array into four chunks and assign each chunk to a separate thread using `std::jthread`. Each thread independently calculates the sum of its assigned chunk using `std::accumulate`. The partial sums are stored in the `partialSums` vector. Finally, we merge all the partial sums using `std::accumulate` to obtain the final sum.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the capabilities of C++20's `std::jthread` class, we can easily implement parallel numerical algorithms in a clean and efficient manner. Parallelizing numerical computations can significantly improve performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores to process the workload concurrently. With proper design and synchronization, we can unlock the full potential of modern hardware and achieve faster numerical calculations.
