In multi-threaded programming, when multiple threads access and modify shared resources simultaneously, it can lead to difficult-to-reproduce bugs and race conditions. **Race conditions occur when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of operations**. To avoid such issues, synchronization mechanisms are used to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at any given time.

One of the synchronization mechanisms provided by the C++ Standard Library is `std::jthread`. It is a type of thread that cooperatively interacts with other threads and provides a safe and convenient way to synchronize access to shared resources.

Let's take a look at how `std::jthread` can be used to synchronize access to shared resources in a multi-threaded program:

## Example Scenario

Consider a scenario where we have a shared counter variable that is accessed and modified by multiple threads. Our objective is to ensure that only one thread can access the counter at any time to prevent race conditions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>

class Counter {
public:
    void increment() {
        std::scoped_lock lock(mutex_);
        value_++;
    }

    int getValue() const {
        std::scoped_lock lock(mutex_);
        return value_;
    }

private:
    int value_ = 0;
    std::mutex mutex_;
};

int main() {
    Counter counter;
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        threads.emplace_back([&counter]() {
            for (int j = 0; j < 100000; j++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });
    }

    for (auto& thread : threads) {
        thread.join();
    }

    std::cout << "Counter value: " << counter.getValue() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
**#cpp #multithreading**

## Explanation

In the above example code, we have a class called `Counter` that encapsulates the shared counter variable. This class provides two member functions: `increment()` and `getValue()`. Both functions use `std::scoped_lock` to acquire a lock on a mutex before accessing or modifying the value.

In the `main()` function, we create an instance of `Counter`. We then create a vector of threads and launch multiple threads, each incrementing the counter `100000` times. The threads are synchronized using mutexes to ensure only one thread can access the `Counter` at a time.

Finally, we wait for all the threads to finish using the `join()` function and then print the final value of the counter.

## Conclusion

With the help of `std::jthread` and synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, we can effectively synchronize access to shared resources in a multi-threaded program. By ensuring that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time, we can prevent race conditions and avoid bugs.

It's important to carefully consider and synchronize access to shared resources in multi-threaded programs to maintain thread safety and avoid unexpected behavior.
