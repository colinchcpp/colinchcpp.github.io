In C++20, the Standard Library introduced `std::jthread`, which is a thread object that automatically joins its associated thread upon destruction. However, there might be scenarios where you don't want the thread to be automatically joined but instead detached, allowing it to continue running independently. In this blog post, we will explore how to detach a `std::jthread` in C++.

## Detaching a std::jthread
To detach a `std::jthread`, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a `std::jthread` object and associate it with your desired thread function or callable object. Ensure the thread function or callable is complete and doesn't reference any local variables.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void threadFunction()
{
    // Perform some computations or operations
    std::cout << "Thread running" << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    std::jthread myThread(threadFunction);

    // Code to detach the std::jthread
    myThread.detach();

    // Rest of the main thread code

    return 0;
}
```

2. After creating the `std::jthread` object, call the `detach()` function on it. This will detach the associated thread from the `std::jthread` object, allowing it to run independently.

By detaching the thread, you no longer need to explicitly join it or wait for it to complete. However, keep in mind that if the `std::jthread` object goes out of scope before the detached thread finishes execution, the program might terminate prematurely. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that the main thread doesn't exit before the detached thread completes its execution.

## Conclusion
Detaching a `std::jthread` in C++ allows the thread to run independently without requiring an explicit join operation. However, caution must be taken to avoid premature termination of the detached thread. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can confidently detach a `std::jthread` and leverage the flexibility it offers in multithreaded applications.
