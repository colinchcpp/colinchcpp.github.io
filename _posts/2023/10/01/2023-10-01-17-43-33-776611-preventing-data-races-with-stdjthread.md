Data races are a common issue in multi-threaded programming, where two or more threads access shared data concurrently without proper synchronization. These data races can lead to unpredictable behavior and bugs that are hard to reproduce and debug.

To address this problem, the C++ Standard Library introduced the `std::jthread` class in C++20. `std::jthread` is a thread wrapper that provides a safe and convenient way to manage threads and prevent data races. 

Here's an example to illustrate how `std::jthread` can prevent data races:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> data; // Shared data

// Worker function that modifies the shared data
void worker()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i)
    {
        // Safely access the shared data using std::jthread
        std::jthread::this_thread::sleep_for< std::chrono::milliseconds >(100);
        data.push_back(i);
    }
}

int main()
{
    std::jthread t1(worker);
    std::jthread t2(worker);

    // Wait for the threads to finish their work
    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    // Print the content of the shared data
    for (const auto& item : data)
    {
        std::cout << item << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have a shared vector `data` that both `t1` and `t2` threads access and modify concurrently. Without proper synchronization, this could lead to a data race. 

We use `std::jthread` to wrap our worker functions, ensuring that each thread is properly joined at the end of `main`. This guarantees that the threads have finished their work before accessing the shared data. Consequently, `std::jthread` helps prevent any data races that might occur when multiple threads modify `data` concurrently.

By utilizing `std::jthread`, we can write more robust and thread-safe code, reducing the chances of data races and improving the overall reliability of our multi-threaded programs.
