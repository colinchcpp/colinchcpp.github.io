Real-time rendering is a critical aspect of many modern applications, including video games, simulations, and virtual reality experiences. Ensuring smooth and responsive visuals in real-time requires efficient multithreading.

In C++, the Standard Library provides several threading options, including `std::thread` and `std::async`. However, with the introduction of C++20, a new addition to the threading library called `std::jthread` was introduced. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage `std::jthread` for real-time rendering.

## What is `std::jthread`?

`std::jthread` is a thread-aware RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) wrapper introduced in C++20. It provides an easy and safe way to create and manage threads by encapsulating both the thread and its associated joinable state.

## Using `std::jthread` for Real-Time Rendering

To illustrate the usage of `std::jthread` in real-time rendering, let's consider a simple example where we want to render a scene in parallel while continuously updating it. We'll assume we have a `Renderer` class that handles rendering and an `Updater` class that updates the scene data.

```cpp
class Renderer {
public:
    void render() {
        // Rendering implementation
    }
};

class Updater {
public:
    void update() {
        // Scene update implementation
    }
};
```

Now, we can create a render loop that utilizes `std::jthread` to perform rendering and updating in parallel:

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

int main() {
    Renderer renderer;
    Updater updater;

    std::jthread renderThread([&]() {
        while (true) {
            renderer.render();
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(16)); // Render at ~60 FPS
        }
    });

    std::jthread updateThread([&]() {
        while (true) {
            updater.update();
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(33)); // Update at ~30 FPS
        }
    });

    // Wait for user input to exit the application
    std::cin.get();
    return 0;
}
```

In the example above, we create two `std::jthread` objects, `renderThread` and `updateThread`, which encapsulate the rendering and updating tasks, respectively. The threads execute their respective tasks in an infinite loop, with appropriate sleep durations to achieve the desired frame rates.

## Benefits of `std::jthread`

Using `std::jthread` for real-time rendering offers several benefits:

1. **Automatic Resource Management**: `std::jthread` automatically joins the thread upon destruction, ensuring proper resource management without the need for manual `join` or `detach` calls.
2. **Exception Safety**: `std::jthread` handles exceptions thrown from the associated thread and ensures proper cleanup, avoiding resource leaks.
3. **Thread Interruption**: `std::jthread` provides a convenient `request_stop()` member function, allowing safe interruption of the associated thread.

## Conclusion

`std::jthread` is a valuable addition to the C++ threading library, especially for real-time rendering scenarios. It simplifies thread management, ensuring resource safety and exception handling. By leveraging `std::jthread`, developers can create responsive and parallel rendering systems that meet the demands of modern applications.
