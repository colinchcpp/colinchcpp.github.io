Memory consistency and synchronization are critical considerations in concurrent programming. Understanding how memory operations are ordered and synchronized is essential for writing correct and efficient parallel code. In this blog post, we will explore the memory consistency models introduced in C++11, extended in C++14 and C++17, and the improvements made in C++20.

## Memory Consistency Models

A **memory consistency model** defines the rules and guarantees regarding the order of memory operations in a concurrent program. It ensures that the results of one thread's operations are visible to other threads in a predictable manner.

### C++11

With the introduction of C++11, a new memory model was defined. The default memory ordering for C++11 is known as **sequentially consistent**. It ensures that memory operations appear to be performed in a globally consistent order across all threads. This ordering is achieved through the use of **locks** or **atomic operations**.

### C++14

In C++14, the memory model was extended to provide more relaxed memory ordering options. The addition of **relaxed** memory ordering allows for more efficient and flexible synchronization between threads. Relaxed ordering enables reordering of non-atomic memory operations as long as the resulting program order is consistent with the single-threaded execution.

### C++17

C++17 introduced the concept of **release-acquire semantics**. This memory ordering provides a partial ordering guarantee between a releasing operation (e.g., `store`) and an acquiring operation (e.g., `load`) on the same atomic variable. This guarantees that all non-atomic memory operations that happen before the releasing operation in the current thread will be visible to other threads before they perform the acquiring operation on that atomic variable.

### C++20

In C++20, the memory model further improved the support for relaxed memory ordering and introduced the concept of **atomic wait operations**, which allows threads to efficiently wait for a specific condition to be satisfied without busy-waiting or wasting CPU cycles.

## Synchronization Primitives

C++ provides several synchronization primitives to ensure memory consistency and synchronization between threads. Let's briefly discuss some of the important ones:

- **Mutexes**: Mutexes are used to guard critical sections of code to ensure that only one thread can enter at a time, preventing data races. C++11 introduced `std::mutex` and its variants.

- **Atomic Types**: Atomic types allow safe access to shared data by guaranteeing that an operation on an atomic variable is either performed atomically or not at all. C++11 introduced atomic types like `std::atomic<int>`.

- **Condition Variables**: Condition variables are used for thread synchronization and enable efficient waiting for a specific condition to be met. C++11 introduced `std::condition_variable`.

## Conclusion

Memory consistency and synchronization are vital aspects to consider when writing concurrent code in C++. Understanding the memory models introduced in different C++ versions and using the appropriate synchronization primitives can help ensure correct and efficient parallel execution.

By leveraging the memory models and synchronization primitives provided by C++, developers can write robust and efficient concurrent programs that take full advantage of the underlying hardware capabilities.
