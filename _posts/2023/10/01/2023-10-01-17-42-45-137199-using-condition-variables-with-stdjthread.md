## What are condition variables?

Condition variables are synchronization primitives that allow threads to wait until a certain condition is met. They are typically used in scenarios where one or more threads need to be notified by another thread when a certain condition becomes true.

## Using condition variables with `std::jthread`

To use condition variables with `std::jthread`, we first need to include the `<condition_variable>` header:

```cpp
#include <condition_variable>
```

Next, we can declare a condition variable object and a mutex to protect access to it:

```cpp
std::condition_variable cv;
std::mutex mutex;
```

In a real-world scenario, we might have a producer thread that produces data and a consumer thread that consumes the data. The producer thread should signal the consumer thread when new data is available. We can achieve this using a condition variable:

```cpp
std::jthread producer([&]{
    // Produce data
    while (true) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        // Produce data
        cv.notify_one(); // Notify consumer
    }
});

std::jthread consumer([&]{
    // Consume data
    while (true) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        cv.wait(lock); // Wait for notification from producer
        // Consume data
    }
});
```

In the producer thread, we use `std::unique_lock` to lock the mutex and notify the consumer thread using `cv.notify_one()`. This will wake up a single consumer thread that is waiting on the condition variable.

In the consumer thread, we also use `std::unique_lock` to lock the mutex, but this time we use `cv.wait(lock)` to wait for the notification from the producer thread. This will release the lock and put the consumer thread to sleep until the notification is received.

## Conclusion

Using condition variables with `std::jthread` provides a simple and efficient way to synchronize the execution of multiple threads. By using condition variables, we can ensure that threads wait until a certain condition becomes true before proceeding. This can greatly simplify concurrent programming and improve the performance of multi-threaded applications.

By incorporating condition variables into your `std::jthread` code, you can effectively manage thread synchronization and coordination, resulting in more efficient and reliable concurrent programs.
