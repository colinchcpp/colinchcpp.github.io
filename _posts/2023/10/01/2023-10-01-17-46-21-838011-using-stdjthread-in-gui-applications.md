`std::jthread` is a RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) wrapper around `std::thread`. It provides a convenient way to launch a thread and automatically join it when the `std::jthread` object is destroyed. This makes it easier to manage the lifecycle of threads and ensures proper cleanup even in the case of exceptions.

Here's an example of how you can use `std::jthread` in a GUI application:

```cpp
// Include necessary headers
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>

// Function to perform a long-running task
void performTask()
{
    // Simulate a long-running task
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));

    // Perform the task
    std::cout << "Task completed!" << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    // Launch a thread using std::jthread
    std::jthread thread(performTask);

    // Continue execution on the main thread
    std::cout << "Main thread continuing..." << std::endl;

    // Wait for the thread to complete
    thread.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `performTask` function simulates a long-running task by sleeping for 5 seconds. The main thread then continues execution while the `std::jthread` object automatically joins the thread when it goes out of scope.

By offloading long-running tasks to a separate thread using `std::jthread`, your GUI application can remain responsive and provide a better user experience. It's important to note that when interacting with GUI elements from the thread, you may need to use additional mechanisms to ensure thread safety, such as using signals or slots in frameworks like Qt.
