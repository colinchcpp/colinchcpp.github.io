With the ever-increasing amount of data that needs to be processed efficiently, parallel computing has become a crucial component of modern software development. The C++ standard library introduced the `<thread>` header to support multi-threading, and with the new C++20 standard, the `<jthread>` header was introduced to provide a higher-level interface for managing threads. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement parallel pattern matching algorithms using the `std::jthread` utility.

## Introduction to Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is a common problem in various domains, including text processing, data analysis, and machine learning. It involves searching for occurrences of a specific pattern within a larger text or dataset. Traditional sequential pattern matching algorithms can be computationally expensive and may not fully utilize available resources. Parallel pattern matching algorithms can significantly improve performance by distributing the workload across multiple threads or processors.

## Utilizing `std::jthread` for Parallelism

The `std::jthread` class is an enhancement over the existing `std::thread` class, introduced in C++20. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing threads with automatic join or detach behavior. To implement parallel pattern matching algorithms, we can leverage the power of `std::jthread` to distribute the workload across multiple threads and efficiently utilize available resources.

Let's consider a simple example of finding occurrences of a word in a text using parallel pattern matching. We will divide the input text into multiple chunks and assign each chunk to a separate thread for processing.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <jthread>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

void patternMatching(const std::string& text, const std::string& pattern) {
    // Divide the text into multiple chunks
    const int chunkSize = text.size() / std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> chunks;
    for (int i = 0; i < text.size(); i += chunkSize) {
        chunks.emplace_back(i, i + chunkSize);
    }

    // Perform pattern matching in parallel
    std::vector<std::jthread> threads;
    for (const auto& chunk : chunks) {
        threads.emplace_back([chunk, &text, &pattern]() {
            for (int i = chunk.first; i < chunk.second; ++i) {
                if (text.substr(i, pattern.size()) == pattern) {
                    std::cout << "Pattern found at index: " << i << std::endl;
                }
            }
        });
    }

    // Wait for all threads to finish
    for (auto& thread: threads) {
        thread.join();
    }
}

int main() {
    std::string text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.";
    std::string pattern = "ipsum";

    patternMatching(text, pattern);

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we divide the input text into chunks based on the number of available hardware threads using `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`. We then create a separate thread for each chunk, performing pattern matching on that specific chunk. Finally, we wait for all threads to finish using the `join()` function.

## Conclusion

By using the `std::jthread` utility from the C++20 standard library, we can easily implement parallel pattern matching algorithms. This allows us to efficiently distribute the workload across multiple threads and fully exploit available resources. The provided example is a simple illustration, and more complex pattern matching algorithms can be implemented using similar principles. Parallelism is a powerful tool for improving performance, and the `std::jthread` class makes it even easier to incorporate parallel computing into your C++ applications.
