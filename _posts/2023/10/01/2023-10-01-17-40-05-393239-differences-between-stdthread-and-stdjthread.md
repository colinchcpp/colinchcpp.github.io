When it comes to multi-threading in C++, the Standard Library provides two main classes for creating and managing threads: `std::thread` and `std::jthread`. While both classes serve the purpose of running code concurrently, they have some important differences that developers should consider when choosing between them.

## 1. Ownership and termination management

One of the key distinctions between `std::thread` and `std::jthread` is how they handle ownership and termination of threads.

- With `std::thread`, the developer is responsible for managing the termination of the thread explicitly by calling `join()` or `detach()` on the thread object. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior or potential resource leaks.

- On the other hand, `std::jthread` introduces a higher-level abstraction that takes care of the termination automatically. When a `std::jthread` object goes out of scope or is explicitly destroyed, it ensures that the associated thread is safely terminated, either by calling `join()` or `detach()` internally. This mitigates the risk of accidental leaks or the need for manual management.

## 2. Exception safety and resource management

`std::jthread` provides a greater level of exception safety and resource management compared to `std::thread`.

- In case of an exception thrown during construction of a `std::thread`, the behavior is implementation-defined and may lead to memory or resource leaks. On the other hand, `std::jthread` guarantees that if an exception is thrown during its construction, it will automatically call `join()` or `detach()` to ensure that resources are cleaned up correctly.

- `std::jthread` also offers a more convenient way to handle exceptions during thread execution. By providing an exception-safe mechanism, using `std::jthread` allows developers to catch and handle any exceptions within the context of the thread, preventing them from propagating and potentially causing program termination.

These differences highlight the advantages of using `std::jthread` over `std::thread` when it comes to ownership and resource management, as well as providing a safer and more convenient interface for handling exceptions.

In conclusion, while both `std::thread` and `std::jthread` serve the purpose of enabling concurrent execution in C++, the latter introduces improved ownership management and exception safety, making it the preferred choice for many developers.
