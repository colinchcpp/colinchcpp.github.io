Real-time data streaming is a critical requirement in various applications, including IoT systems, chat applications, stock market analysis, and many others. The ability to process data in real-time can provide valuable insights and enable quick decision-making. In this blog post, we will explore how to use `std::jthread`, introduced in C++20, for real-time data streaming.

## What is `std::jthread`?

`std::jthread` is a new class added to the C++20 standard library that represents a joinable thread. It is an improvement over `std::thread` as it automatically joins the thread upon destruction. This removes the need for explicitly calling `join()` or `detach()`, making code more reliable and easy to maintain.

## Real-Time Data Streaming Scenario

Let's consider a real-time data streaming scenario where we are receiving sensor data from multiple devices and need to process it as soon as it arrives. For simplicity, let's assume we have a single sensor and want to continuously stream its readings to a processing unit.

## Implementing Real-Time Data Streaming

To implement real-time data streaming, we can create a `std::jthread` that reads data from the sensor and passes it to a processing function. Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void sensorDataStream(std::stop_token stopToken)
{
    // Simulating continuous data stream from sensor
    while (!stopToken.stop_requested())
    {
        // Read sensor data
        double sensorReading = readSensorData();

        // Process the data
        processSensorData(sensorReading);
    }
}

int main()
{
    std::jthread dataStreamThread(sensorDataStream);

    // Perform other operations or wait for the data stream to finish

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, `sensorDataStream` is the function that represents our data streaming pipeline. It continuously reads data from the sensor and processes it until a stop signal is received. We use `std::stop_token` to check if the thread should be stopped. Inside the while loop, we read sensor data using the `readSensorData` function and process it using the `processSensorData` function.

In the `main` function, we create a `std::jthread` object, `dataStreamThread`, passing the `sensorDataStream` function as a callable. This starts the data streaming thread, which runs concurrently with the main thread.

## Conclusion

By using `std::jthread`, we can streamline the implementation of real-time data streaming in C++. It provides a convenient way to manage joinable threads, eliminating the need for manual thread joining or detaching. Incorporating real-time data streaming capabilities can greatly enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of your applications in various domains.
