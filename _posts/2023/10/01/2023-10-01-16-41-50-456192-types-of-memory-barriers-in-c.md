Memory barriers, also known as memory fences, are essential in multithreaded programming to ensure correct synchronization and ordering of memory operations. They prevent reordering of memory operations by the compiler and the processor, which could lead to unexpected and incorrect behavior.

In C++, there are several types of memory barriers that can be used to enforce memory ordering:

1. **Acquire Barrier**: Also known as a "read barrier" or "load barrier," an acquire barrier prevents memory reads from being reordered before the barrier. It ensures that any memory operations preceding the barrier, which are necessary for proper synchronization, are completed before the subsequent read operation.

   Example usage:
   ```cpp
   // Acquire Barrier
   std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire);
   ```

2. **Release Barrier**: Also known as a "write barrier" or "store barrier," a release barrier ensures that memory writes performed prior to the barrier are not reordered after the barrier. It guarantees that any store operations preceding the barrier are visible to other threads that perform subsequent read operations.

   Example usage:
   ```cpp
   // Release Barrier
   std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release);
   ```

3. **Full Barrier**: A full barrier, also known as a "read-write barrier" or "read-modify-write barrier," provides both acquire and release semantics. It ensures that all memory operations, both reads, and writes, are properly ordered before and after the barrier.

   Example usage:
   ```cpp
   // Full Barrier
   std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst);
   ```

These are some of the commonly used memory barriers in C++. They are provided by the `std::atomic_thread_fence` function, which allows programmers to explicitly enforce memory ordering constraints in multithreaded scenarios.

Remember to use memory barriers judiciously, as unnecessarily applying barriers can impact performance. Understanding the specific synchronization requirements of your code is crucial for choosing the appropriate memory barriers.
