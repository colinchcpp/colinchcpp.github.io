In the world of C++ development, using pre-compiled libraries can significantly speed up the development process, improving code reusability and reducing the time spent on building and linking dependencies. Docker, on the other hand, provides a powerful platform for packaging and distributing applications and their dependencies. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage Docker to share and distribute pre-compiled C++ libraries.

### Why use Docker for sharing libraries?

When sharing pre-compiled C++ libraries, one common challenge is ensuring compatibility between different platforms and configurations. Without a proper setup, developers who want to use these libraries might run into compatibility issues or spend a lot of time configuring their systems to match the requirements.

Docker solves this problem by providing a consistent and reproducible environment. By packaging pre-compiled libraries with their dependencies into a Docker container, we can ensure that anyone using the container will have the same environment and configuration. This makes it easier for developers to use the libraries without worrying about compatibility issues.

### Step by step guide

**Step 1:** Create a Dockerfile

First, we need to create a Dockerfile that defines the Docker image. Here's an example Dockerfile for sharing a pre-compiled C++ library:

```dockerfile
# Use a base image with the desired operating system and minimal dependencies
FROM debian:buster-slim

# Copy the pre-compiled library files to a location inside the container
COPY my_library.so /usr/local/lib/

# Set the library path so that it can be found at runtime
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

# Add any additional dependencies required by the library
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y <additional-dependencies>

# Define the entry point for the container
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

In this example, we use a Debian-based image as the base, copy our pre-compiled library (`my_library.so`) to `/usr/local/lib/` inside the container, set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to point to the library location, install any additional dependencies required by the library, and finally define the entry point as `/bin/bash`.

**Step 2:** Build the Docker image

Once we have the Dockerfile ready, we can build the Docker image using the following command:

```shell
docker build -t my_library:1.0 .
```

This command builds the Docker image with the tag `my_library:1.0`, using the current directory (where the Dockerfile is located) as the build context.

**Step 3:** Share the Docker image

To share the Docker image containing our pre-compiled C++ library, we can push it to a container registry like Docker Hub or a private registry. This allows other developers to easily pull the image and use the library in their projects.

```shell
docker push my_library:1.0
```

This command pushes the Docker image to the configured container registry, making it accessible to others.

**Step 4:** Use the Docker image

Developers who want to use the pre-compiled C++ library can simply pull the Docker image and run it as a container. Here's an example command to run the Docker image:

```shell
docker run --rm -it my_library:1.0 /bin/bash
```

This command runs the Docker image with the tag `my_library:1.0`, opens an interactive bash shell in the container, and cleans up the container (`--rm`) after it exits (`-it`). Developers can then compile their C++ code using the pre-compiled library inside the container.

### Conclusion

Using Docker to share and distribute pre-compiled C++ libraries provides a convenient and reliable solution for ensuring compatibility across different platforms and configurations. By packaging the libraries with their dependencies into a Docker container, developers can easily use them without worrying about compatibility issues or manual setup.
