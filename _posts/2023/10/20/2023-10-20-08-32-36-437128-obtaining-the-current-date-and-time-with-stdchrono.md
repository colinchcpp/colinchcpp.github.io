In C++, the `<chrono>` library provides a convenient way to work with time durations and time points. With `std::chrono`, you can easily obtain the current date and time. Let's see how we can do this.

## Including the necessary header

First, we need to include the `<chrono>` header in our code:

```cpp
#include <chrono>
```

## Getting the current time point

To obtain the current time point, we'll use the `std::chrono::system_clock::now()` function. This function returns the current time point based on the system clock. Here's an example:

```cpp
auto currentTime = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
```

The `currentTime` variable will now hold the current time point.

## Converting the time point to a specific format

If you want to obtain the current date and time in a specific format, you can use the `std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t()` function along with `std::localtime()` or `std::gmtime()` to convert the time point to a `std::tm` structure.

Here's an example that converts the time point to a `std::tm` structure and extracts the current date and time components:

```cpp
std::time_t currentTimeT = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(currentTime);
std::tm* currentTimeStruct = std::localtime(&currentTimeT);

int year = currentTimeStruct->tm_year + 1900;
int month = currentTimeStruct->tm_mon + 1;
int day = currentTimeStruct->tm_mday;
int hour = currentTimeStruct->tm_hour;
int minute = currentTimeStruct->tm_min;
int second = currentTimeStruct->tm_sec;

std::cout << "Current date and time: " << year << "-" << month << "-" << day << " " << hour << ":" << minute << ":" << second << std::endl;
```

The code above uses `std::localtime()` to convert the time point to a `tm` structure and then extracts the individual components using the appropriate members of the structure.

## Conclusion

With `std::chrono`, obtaining the current date and time in C++ is straightforward. By using `std::chrono::system_clock::now()` to get the time point and then converting it to the desired format, you can easily access the current date and time information.

For more information, you can refer to the [C++ reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono) for `std::chrono` and its related functions and classes.
