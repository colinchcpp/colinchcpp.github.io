## What is Image Denoising? {#what-is-image-denoising}

Image denoising is the process of removing noise from images, which can be introduced during image acquisition or transmission. Noise can degrade the quality of images by causing unwanted artifacts and reducing the clarity of important details.

## Popular Image Denoising Techniques {#popular-image-denoising-techniques}

### Gaussian Filtering {#gaussian-filtering}

Gaussian filtering is a simple and widely used technique for image denoising. It applies a Gaussian filter to the image, which effectively smooths out the noise while preserving the overall image structure. The filtering is based on convolving the image with a Gaussian kernel.

### Non-local Means Denoising {#non-local-means-denoising}

Non-local means denoising is a powerful technique that exploits the redundancy present in natural images. It works by averaging similar image patches to estimate the value of each pixel. This method is effective at removing both additive and impulsive noise while preserving important image details.

### Wavelet Denoising {#wavelet-denoising}

Wavelet denoising is an approach that decomposes an image into different frequency bands using wavelet transforms. By applying thresholding techniques to the wavelet coefficients, the noisy details can be removed, leaving behind a denoised image.

## Implementing Image Denoising in C++ {#implementing-image-denoising-in-c++}

### Gaussian Filtering in C++ {#gaussian-filtering-in-c++}

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

void denoiseImageGaussian(const cv::Mat& inputImage, cv::Mat& outputImage, double sigma)
{
    cv::GaussianBlur(inputImage, outputImage, cv::Size(0, 0), sigma);
}
```

### Non-local Means Denoising in C++ {#non-local-means-denoising-in-c++}

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

void denoiseImageNonLocalMeans(const cv::Mat& inputImage, cv::Mat& outputImage, double h, double sigma)
{
    cv::fastNlMeansDenoising(inputImage, outputImage, h, sigma);
}
```

### Wavelet Denoising in C++ {#wavelet-denoising-in-c++}

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

void denoiseImageWavelet(const cv::Mat& inputImage, cv::Mat& outputImage, double threshold)
{
    cv::Mat coeffs;
    cv::dwt2(inputImage, coeffs, cv::DWT_FORWARD);
    cv::threshold(coeffs, coeffs, threshold, 0, cv::THRESH_TOZERO);
    cv::idwt2(coeffs, outputImage, cv::DWT_INVERSE);
}
```

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Image denoising is an essential task in image processing, and C++ provides a robust environment for implementing various denoising techniques. In this blog post, we explored popular denoising techniques such as Gaussian filtering, non-local means denoising, and wavelet denoising. We also provided C++ code examples for implementing each technique.
