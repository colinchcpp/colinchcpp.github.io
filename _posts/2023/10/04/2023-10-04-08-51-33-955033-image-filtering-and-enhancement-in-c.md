## Introduction to Image Filtering
Image filtering involves altering the pixels of an image to achieve specific effects or enhance certain characteristics. It is commonly used for tasks such as noise reduction, edge detection, and sharpening. 

## Types of Image Filtering
There are two main types of image filtering techniques: spatial domain filtering and frequency domain filtering.

### Spatial Domain Filtering
Spatial domain filtering operates on images directly in the spatial domain (pixels). It applies a filter mask to each pixel and its surrounding neighborhood to calculate a new pixel value. Common spatial domain filters include blur, sharpen, and edge detection filters.

### Frequency Domain Filtering
Frequency domain filtering involves converting an image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain using a technique called Fourier Transform. Once in the frequency domain, filtering operations can be performed, and the image is then transformed back to the spatial domain using the Inverse Fourier Transform.

## Image Enhancement Techniques
Image enhancement techniques aim to improve the visual quality or extract useful information from an image. Here are two widely used image enhancement techniques:

### Histogram Equalization
Histogram equalization adjusts the intensity distribution of an image to more evenly distribute pixel values. This technique can enhance the contrast and improve the overall appearance of an image.

### Contrast Stretching
Contrast stretching expands the dynamic range of an image by reassigning pixel values to span a broader range. It is useful for enhancing images with low contrast or limited brightness levels.

## Implementing Image Filtering and Enhancement in C++
To perform image filtering and enhancement in C++, you can make use of libraries such as OpenCV or the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). 

Let's take an example of how to apply a blur filter using OpenCV:

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

int main() {
    cv::Mat image = cv::imread("input.jpg", cv::IMREAD_COLOR); // Read image file
    cv::Mat blurred;
    
    // Apply blur filter
    cv::GaussianBlur(image, blurred, cv::Size(5, 5), 0);
    
    cv::imwrite("output.jpg", blurred); // Save the blurred image
    
    return 0;
}
```

In the example above, we use the `cv::GaussianBlur()` function from OpenCV to apply a Gaussian blur filter to the input image. The resulting image is then saved as "output.jpg". 

## Conclusion
Image filtering and enhancement are vital techniques in the field of computer vision and image processing. They allow us to improve image quality, extract relevant information, and perform various tasks on images. With the help of libraries like OpenCV and C++ programming, we can efficiently implement these techniques and achieve desired results.
