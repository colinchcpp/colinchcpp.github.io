In the world of photography and computer vision, panoramic imaging is a technique that allows capturing and stitching together multiple images to create a wide-angle or 360-degree view of a scene. C++ is a powerful programming language that can be used to implement various aspects of panoramic imaging, ranging from image processing and feature detection to image stitching and blending. In this blog post, we will explore how C++ can be leveraged to develop panoramic imaging applications.
