Audio normalization is a technique used to adjust the volume levels of audio recordings to ensure consistent loudness across different tracks or parts of a track. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio normalization in C++.

## Understanding Audio Normalization

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand the concept of audio normalization. The primary goal of audio normalization is to bring the audio signal to a desired level or target loudness. This process involves analyzing the audio data to determine its peak amplitude and then scaling the signal to achieve the desired loudness level.

## Implementing Audio Normalization in C++

To implement audio normalization in C++, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the audio file: Start by reading the audio file using a suitable library such as libsoundfile or libmpg123. These libraries provide functions to read audio files in various formats (e.g., WAV, MP3) and obtain the audio data.

2. Calculate the peak amplitude: Iterate through the audio data and find the maximum peak amplitude. This can be done by comparing the absolute values of each sample and keeping track of the highest value encountered. This will give us the peak amplitude of the audio.

3. Calculate the scaling factor: Once we have the peak amplitude, we need to calculate the scaling factor that will bring the audio to the desired loudness level. The scaling factor can be calculated using the formula:

```
scaling_factor = target_amplitude / peak_amplitude
```

where `target_amplitude` is the desired peak amplitude or loudness level.

4. Apply the scaling factor: Multiply each sample in the audio data by the scaling factor obtained in the previous step. This will normalize the audio and bring it to the desired loudness level.

5. Write the normalized audio: Finally, write the normalized audio data to a new audio file or overwrite the existing file. Use the library functions provided to save the audio data in the desired format.

## Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

void normalizeAudio(const std::string& inputFilePath, const std::string& outputFilePath, float targetAmplitude) {
    // Read the audio file
    std::ifstream inputFile(inputFilePath, std::ios::binary);
    // Process the audio data...
    // Calculate the peak amplitude...
    // Calculate the scaling factor...

    // Apply the scaling factor and write the normalized audio
}

int main() {
    std::string inputFile = "input.wav";
    std::string outputFile = "output.wav";
    float targetAmplitude = 0.8;

    normalizeAudio(inputFile, outputFile, targetAmplitude);

    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

Audio normalization is a crucial step in audio processing to ensure consistent loudness levels. By implementing audio normalization in C++, you can control the volume levels of your audio files programmatically. This can be beneficial for various applications, from audio editing software to audio streaming platforms.
