Audio effects play a crucial role in enhancing the quality and realism of audio recordings or simulations. One popular effect is room reverb, which adds the characteristics of a specific acoustic space to the audio signal. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement room reverbs using C++.

## What is Room Reverb?

Room reverb simulates the effect of sound reflecting off various surfaces within a room, such as walls, floors, and ceilings. It adds a sense of depth and space to audio recordings by mimicking the natural reverberations that occur in different environments.

## Choosing a Library

To implement room reverbs in C++, we need a good audio processing library. One popular choice is the **JUCE** framework, which provides a comprehensive set of tools and classes for audio development. Its audio processing capabilities make it well-suited for implementing room reverbs.

## Creating a Room Reverb Class

To get started, we will create a RoomReverb class in C++ using JUCE. This class will encapsulate the functionality required to apply room reverb effects to incoming audio signals. Here's an example implementation:

```cpp
#include <juce_dsp/juce_dsp.h>

class RoomReverb
{
public:
    RoomReverb(float roomSize, float decayTime, float damping)
    {
        dsp::Reverb::Parameters params;

        // Set room size (0-1)
        params.roomSize = roomSize;

        // Set decay time in seconds
        params.decayTime = decayTime;

        // Set damping (0-1)
        params.damping = damping;

        // Create the reverb object
        reverb = std::make_unique<dsp::Reverb>();
        reverb->setParameters(params);
    }

    float processSample(float inputSample)
    {
        // Process and return the output sample
        return reverb->processSample(inputSample);
    }

private:
    std::unique_ptr<dsp::Reverb> reverb;
};
```

In this example, we are using the JUCE `dsp::Reverb` class to handle the room reverb processing. The constructor takes parameters such as `roomSize`, `decayTime`, and `damping` to set the properties of the reverb effect. The `processSample` function applies the reverb effect to an incoming audio sample and returns the processed output.

## Using the Room Reverb Class

To apply the room reverb effect to an audio signal, you would typically iterate over the audio samples and process each sample using the `RoomReverb` class. Here's an example of how you could implement it:

```cpp
RoomReverb roomReverb(0.8f, 2.0f, 0.5f);

// Iterate over audio samples
for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i)
{
    // Get the input sample
    float inputSample = audioBuffer[i];

    // Apply room reverb processing
    float outputSample = roomReverb.processSample(inputSample);

    // Store the output sample back to the buffer
    audioBuffer[i] = outputSample;
}
```

In this example, `roomReverb` is an instance of the `RoomReverb` class that we created earlier. We iterate over the audio samples, apply the room reverb processing to each sample using the `processSample` function, and store the result back into the audio buffer.

## Conclusion

Implementing audio effects such as room reverbs can greatly enhance the quality and realism of audio recordings or simulations. By utilizing tools such as JUCE and the `dsp::Reverb` class, you can easily incorporate room reverb effects into your C++ projects. Experiment with different parameter values to achieve the desired acoustic characteristics for a more engaging audio experience!
