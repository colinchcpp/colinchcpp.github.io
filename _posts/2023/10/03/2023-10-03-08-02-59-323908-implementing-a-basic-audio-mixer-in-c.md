## Introduction

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a basic audio mixer in C++. An audio mixer is a crucial component in applications that deal with audio processing, such as music production software or multimedia applications.

## Understanding Audio Mixing

Audio mixing involves combining multiple audio sources into a single output stream. Each audio source can have its own volume, panning, and other effects applied. The goal is to achieve a balanced and coherent sound by adjusting the individual audio sources' parameters.

## Approach

To implement a basic audio mixer in C++, we will use the following steps:

1. Create a class to represent an audio source.
2. Add properties to the audio source class, such as volume and panning.
3. Create a mixer class to handle the mixing of audio sources.
4. Implement the audio mixing algorithm in the mixer class.
5. Test the implementation using sample audio sources.

## Implementation

Let's start by creating the `AudioSource` class:

```cpp
class AudioSource {
  public:
    float volume;
    float panning;
    // Other properties and methods
};
```

In the `AudioSource` class, we have added two properties: `volume` and `panning`. These properties determine the audio source's volume level and its spatial position in the stereo field.

Next, let's create the `AudioMixer` class:

```cpp
class AudioMixer {
  public:
    std::vector<AudioSource> audioSources;
    
    std::vector<float> mixAudio() {
      std::vector<float> mixedAudio;
      
      // Mixing algorithm implementation
      
      return mixedAudio;
    }
};
```

The `AudioMixer` class contains a vector of `AudioSource` objects, representing the audio sources we want to mix. The `mixAudio` method will be responsible for combining the audio data from all the sources and returning the mixed audio.

For the mixing algorithm, we can iterate over each audio source, apply any desired effects or transformations, and combine the audio data. Here's a basic example:

```cpp
std::vector<float> AudioMixer::mixAudio() {
  std::vector<float> mixedAudio;
  int numSamples = audioSources[0].getNumSamples(); // Assuming a method to get the number of samples
  
  for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {
    float sample = 0.0;
    
    for (const auto &source : audioSources) {
      float normalizedVolume = source.volume / audioSources.size();
      
      // Apply panning, effects, and other transformations to the sample
      
      sample += source.getSample(i) * normalizedVolume;
    }
    
    mixedAudio.push_back(sample);
  }
  
  return mixedAudio;
}
```

Note that this is a simplified version of the mixing algorithm, and more advanced techniques can be used depending on the requirements of your application.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to implement a basic audio mixer in C++. By creating an `AudioSource` class to represent individual audio sources, and a `AudioMixer` class to handle the mixing process, we can combine audio sources and create a mixed output. This implementation can serve as a starting point for building more advanced audio processing applications.
