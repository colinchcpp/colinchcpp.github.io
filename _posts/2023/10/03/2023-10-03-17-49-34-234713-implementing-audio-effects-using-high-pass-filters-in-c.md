In audio processing, **high-pass filters** are commonly used to remove or suppress low-frequency signals, allowing higher-frequency components to pass through. This can be useful in applications such as audio equalization, noise reduction, and audio enhancement.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement a high-pass filter using C++. Let's dive in!

## High-Pass Filter Basics

A high-pass filter allows signals above a certain cutoff frequency to pass through, while attenuating signals below this frequency. The cutoff frequency determines the point at which the filter starts attenuating the signal. 

## Implementing a High-Pass Filter in C++

To implement a high-pass filter in C++, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Design the Filter

First, we need to design the high-pass filter. There are different filter design methods available, such as Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Elliptic filters. Choose a suitable filter design method based on your requirements.

### Step 2: Initialize Filter Coefficients

Once the filter design is completed, initialize the filter coefficients. These coefficients determine the behavior of the filter. The exact method to calculate the coefficients will depend on the chosen filter design method.

```cpp
// Filter coefficients initialization
float a0, a1, a2, b1, b2;
```

### Step 3: Process Audio Input

Next, we need to process the audio input using the high-pass filter. We'll iterate through the audio samples and apply the filter to each sample.

```cpp
// Process audio input
for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {
    // Apply filter to each sample
    float filteredSample = (a0 * inputSample[i]) + (a1 * inputSample[i-1]) + (a2 * inputSample[i-2])
                           - (b1 * outputSample[i-1]) - (b2 * outputSample[i-2]);

    // Store filtered sample as output
    outputSample[i] = filteredSample;
}
```

### Step 4: Apply Filter Gain (Optional)

After applying the filter, you may consider applying a gain to the output signal to compensate for any attenuation caused by the filter.

```cpp
// Apply filter gain
for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {
    outputSample[i] *= filterGain;
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing audio effects using high-pass filters in C++ can greatly enhance the audio processing capabilities of your applications. By selectively attenuating low-frequency components, you can achieve a cleaner and more focused sound.

Remember to experiment with different filter designs and fine-tune the filter coefficients to achieve the desired audio effect. Play around with cutoff frequencies and gain values to find the best settings for your application.

By understanding the basics of high-pass filters and implementing them in C++, you can take your audio processing to the next level.
