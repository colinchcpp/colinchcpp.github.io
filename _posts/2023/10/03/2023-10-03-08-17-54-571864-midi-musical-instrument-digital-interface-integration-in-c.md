In the world of music production and electronic instruments, **MIDI** (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a widely used protocol for communication between musical devices. MIDI allows for sending and receiving commands, such as note on/off messages, control change messages, and more.

If you're a C++ developer interested in integrating MIDI functionality into your applications, you're in the right place. In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of MIDI integration using C++.

## MIDI Libraries

To simplify the process of MIDI integration, various C++ libraries are available that provide easy-to-use interfaces for working with MIDI messages. Let's take a look at two popular options:

### 1. RtMIDI

**RtMIDI** is a cross-platform MIDI library that enables C++ developers to easily send and receive MIDI messages. It supports a wide range of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

To get started with RtMIDI, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the RtMIDI library on your system. You can find the installation instructions on the [official RtMIDI GitHub repository](https://github.com/thestk/rtmidi).

2. Create a new C++ project and include the RtMIDI headers in your source files.

3. Use the RtMIDI API to open MIDI ports, send MIDI messages, and receive MIDI input.

### 2. JUCE

**JUCE** is a powerful framework that provides a comprehensive set of tools for developing audio and MIDI applications. It supports a wide range of platforms, including desktop and mobile.

To get started with JUCE MIDI integration, you can follow these steps:

1. Download and install the JUCE framework from the [official JUCE website](https://juce.com).

2. Set up a new JUCE project and configure the necessary settings.

3. Utilize the JUCE API for handling MIDI events, sending MIDI messages, and managing MIDI devices.

## Example MIDI Integration in C++

Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to integrate MIDI using the RtMIDI library in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <RtMidi.h>

int main() {
    RtMidiOut midiOut;
    std::vector<unsigned char> message;

    // Open the first available MIDI output port
    midiOut.openPort(0);

    // Send a note on message (note 60, velocity 127) on channel 1
    message.push_back(0x90);
    message.push_back(60);
    message.push_back(127);
    midiOut.sendMessage(&message);

    // Delay for 1 second
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));

    // Send a note off message (note 60) on channel 1
    message[0] = 0x80;
    message[2] = 0;
    midiOut.sendMessage(&message);

    // Close the MIDI output port
    midiOut.closePort();

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates opening a MIDI output port, sending a note on message (with note 60 and velocity 127), delaying for 1 second, and then sending a note off message. Finally, the MIDI output port is closed.

## Conclusion

Integrating MIDI functionality into your C++ applications opens up a world of possibilities in music production, performance, and more. By utilizing libraries such as RtMIDI or JUCE, you can easily send and receive MIDI messages, control MIDI devices, and create rich musical experiences.
