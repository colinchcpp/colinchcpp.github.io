Source-to-source compilers, also known as transpilers, are tools that translate the source code of one programming language into the source code of another language while preserving the functionality of the original code. In the context of C++, there are several open-source transpilers available that can help simplify the process of migrating code from one version of C++ to another, or even from C++ to another language. In this blog post, we will explore some popular open-source C++ source-to-source compilers that you can leverage for your projects.

## 1. Clang

**Clang** is a widely-used open-source C++ compiler based on the LLVM infrastructure. Besides being a full-fledged compiler, Clang also offers a source-to-source transformation framework called **Clang Tooling**. It provides a set of APIs and libraries for building custom tools that operate on C++ source code. With Clang Tooling, you can write plugins or scripts to analyze, refactor, or transform C++ code, making it an excellent choice for source-to-source compilation tasks.

To utilize Clang for source-to-source compilation, you can write a plugin using Clang's API or leverage the **LibTooling** library, which simplifies the development of standalone tools. By traversing the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated by Clang, you can modify the code, replace specific constructs, or generate new code.

Using Clang for source-to-source compilation is advantageous as it leverages Clang's robust and well-maintained infrastructure, ensuring compatibility with various C++ standards and correct handling of complex language features.

**ROSE Compiler** is an open-source research compiler for C, C++, and Fortran developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It offers advanced source-to-source transformation capabilities, making it a powerful tool for code migration, optimization, and refactoring. ROSE is implemented in C++ and provides a set of C++ APIs for building custom source-to-source compilers.

ROSE Compiler's strength lies in its ability to handle complex C++ programs, including those using modern language features. It provides options for traversing and manipulating the AST, enabling modifications like adding/removing code, rewriting expressions, or reorganizing the program structure. Additionally, ROSE can perform various static analyses and optimizations, making it useful not only for source-to-source compilation but also for program analysis tasks.

Using ROSE Compiler for source-to-source compilation offers flexibility and control over the transformation process, empowering developers to tailor the tool to their specific needs.

## Conclusion

Open-source C++ source-to-source compilers provide valuable resources for code migration, refactoring, and optimization tasks. Clang, with its Clang Tooling framework, offers a mature and feature-rich ecosystem for modifying C++ code. On the other hand, ROSE Compiler provides advanced transformation capabilities and static analysis features. By utilizing these tools, developers can streamline their code migration efforts and improve code quality.

When choosing a source-to-source compiler, consider factors such as the complexity of your codebase, the specific transformations required, and the compatibility with the C++ standard you are targeting. Fortunately, both Clang and ROSE Compiler address these considerations effectively, making them popular choices in the C++ community.
