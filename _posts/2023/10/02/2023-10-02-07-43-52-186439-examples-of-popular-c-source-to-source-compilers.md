C++ source-to-source compilers are tools that transform C++ code from one form to another without changing its behavior. They are widely used for various purposes, including optimizing code, refactoring, and generating alternative versions of the code. In this blog post, we'll explore some popular C++ source-to-source compilers that are used in the industry today.

## Clang/LLVM Compiler

**Clang/LLVM** is a widely-used open-source compiler infrastructure that supports multiple programming languages, including C++. It provides a comprehensive set of tools, including a C++ frontend, a source-to-source transformation framework, and an optimizing backend.

One of the main features of Clang is its ability to perform source-to-source transformations using its *libTooling* library. This library allows developers to write custom transformations using C++ APIs. It provides access to the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the code, allowing developers to analyze and modify it easily.

Clang/LLVM is highly extensible and has a vibrant community that develops various source-to-source transformation tools and plugins. Some popular Clang-based tools include **Clang-format** for code formatting, **Clang-tidy** for static analysis, and **Clang-rename** for renaming symbols.

## ROSE Compiler

**ROSE** is another popular C++ source-to-source compiler that is widely used in both academia and industry. It is an open-source compiler infrastructure developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and supports C, C++, and Fortran.

ROSE provides a high-level programming API that allows developers to parse, analyze, and transform C++ code. It allows users to traverse the AST and apply custom transformations to the code. It also provides a set of built-in analysis and transformation tools, such as loop transformation, array privatization, and function inlining.

ROSE's extensible architecture makes it suitable for research purposes and enables the development of custom source-to-source transformations. The compiler has been used in various domains, including parallel programming, code synthesis, and program understanding.

## Conclusion

C++ source-to-source compilers play a critical role in optimizing and transforming C++ code. They provide developers with powerful tools to analyze and modify code easily, enabling better performance and maintainability.

In this blog post, we explored two popular C++ source-to-source compilers: Clang/LLVM and ROSE. Both compilers offer extensive features and APIs for performing source-to-source transformations. They have been widely adopted by the industry and research communities.

So, depending on your specific needs and requirements, you can choose either Clang/LLVM or ROSE as your go-to source-to-source compiler for C++. Happy coding!
