As software developers, we often encounter situations where we need to modify existing C++ codebases but are limited by the complexity, size, or lack of documentation. In such cases, a source-to-source compiler can be a game-changer. Source-to-source compilers allow us to transform, optimize, or rewrite source code in a high-level programming language to obtain a more efficient or specialized version of the original code.

While there are several open-source source-to-source compilers available, in this blog post, we will focus on commercial options that provide powerful features and expert support. Without further ado, let's explore three noteworthy commercial C++ source-to-source compilers:

## 1. [Intel® C++ Compiler](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/compilers/c-compilers.html) 

Intel® C++ Compiler is a high-performance C++ compiler that seamlessly integrates with popular development environments like Visual Studio. It offers advanced optimization capabilities and supports various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. This compiler provides source-to-source transformation capabilities through the Intel® Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) language extension, allowing developers to write code targeting CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs for parallel processing.

## 2. [IBM® XL C/C++](https://www.ibm.com/products/xl-cpp) 

IBM® XL C/C++ is a powerful optimizing compiler designed for the IBM Power Systems™ platform. It provides advanced compilation technologies and features to improve code performance and deliver optimal results on IBM Power® processors. With its source-to-source transformation capabilities, IBM® XL C/C++ enables developers to efficiently leverage hardware-specific features, such as vectorization, parallelism, and memory optimization.

## 3. [PGI Community Edition](https://www.pgroup.com/products/community.htm) 

PGI Community Edition, by NVIDIA, is a free version of the PGI compiler suite that includes the PGI C++ compiler. While the commercial version offers additional features and support, the Community Edition still provides powerful source-to-source transformation capabilities. It allows developers to analyze and optimize code targeting NVIDIA GPUs, leveraging OpenACC directives for parallel programming.

These commercial compilers offer sophisticated source-to-source transformation options that can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of your C++ codebases. Consider evaluating these options based on your specific requirements and goals.
