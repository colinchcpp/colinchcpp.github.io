C++ is a powerful and widely-used programming language that allows developers to build high-performance applications. However, there are cases where companies may want to convert their C++ code to another language for various reasons, such as portability or interoperability. In this blog post, we will explore some real-world examples of companies that use C++ source-to-source compilers to transform their C++ code into another language.

## 1. Google - Go Programming Language

One prominent example is Google, which is known for its contributions to the open-source community. Google has developed a C++ source-to-source compiler called "Gopher" that converts C++ code into Go, a popular programming language also created by Google. This conversion allows developers to port C++ code into Go and take advantage of Go's simplicity, concurrency features, and robust runtime.

Google uses Gopher internally to migrate large C++ codebases to Go, improving development productivity and making use of Go's modern features. Gopher helps Google leverage the benefits of Go's garbage collector, static typing, and built-in concurrency mechanisms, while maintaining compatibility with their existing C++ codebase.

## 2. Facebook - Hack Programming Language

Facebook is another tech giant that leverages source-to-source compilation techniques to transform C++ code. Facebook has developed the "Hack" programming language, which is a dialect of PHP that adds static typing and other modern features to the language.

To ensure maximum interoperability and improve performance, Facebook uses a C++ to Hack source-to-source compiler. This tool allows Facebook to automatically convert C++ code into Hack. By doing so, Facebook can maintain compatibility with their existing PHP-based codebase while taking advantage of the safety, type checking, and performance optimizations offered by the Hack language.

## Conclusion

These are just a few examples of companies that use C++ source-to-source compilers to transform their code into different programming languages. By leveraging these compilers, companies can benefit from the features and performance enhancements offered by alternative languages while maintaining compatibility with their existing codebases.

C++ source-to-source compilers provide a practical solution for companies looking to explore new programming languages without having to completely rewrite their code from scratch. The ability to convert C++ code into other languages allows for increased productivity, improved performance, and better interoperability within complex software systems.
