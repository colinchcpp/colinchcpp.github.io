## Inline Function Expansion
Inlining is an optimization technique where the compiler replaces a function call with the actual body of the function. This eliminates the overhead of function call and return, potentially resulting in faster execution. Source-to-source compilers can automatically inline functions that are marked as "inline" or determine when it is beneficial to inline a function based on the code analysis.

```cpp
inline int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 10);
    // After optimization, the function call is replaced with the actual addition
    // int result = 5 + 10;
    return 0;
}
```

## Loop Unrolling
Loop unrolling is a technique where the compiler optimizes loops by replicating loop bodies, reducing the number of iterations needed. This optimization can improve cache utilization and decrease loop overhead. Source-to-source compilers can analyze loop patterns, determine if unrolling is beneficial, and automatically transform the code accordingly.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Loop body
    // After unrolling, the loop is expanded
    // Loop body (iteration 0)
    // Loop body (iteration 1)
    // ...
    // Loop body (iteration 9)
}
```

## Common Subexpression Elimination
Common subexpression elimination is an optimization technique where the compiler identifies common calculations performed within a program and eliminates redundant computations. This optimization can reduce the number of instructions executed and improve overall performance. Source-to-source compilers perform advanced analysis to identify common subexpressions and replace redundant computations with precomputed values.

```cpp
int calculate(int a, int b, int c) {
    int result1 = a * b + c;
    int result2 = a * b + c;  // Common subexpression
    // After optimization, the redundant calculation is eliminated
    // int result1 = a * b + c;
    // int result2 = result1;
    return result1 + result2;
}
```

## Loop Fusion
Loop fusion is an optimization technique where the compiler combines multiple loops into a single loop to reduce loop overhead and improve cache utilization. This optimization can avoid redundant iterations and improve data locality. Source-to-source compilers analyze loop dependencies and data access patterns to identify opportunities for loop fusion and automatically transform the code accordingly.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    // Loop 1
    // ...
}

for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
    // Loop 2
    // ...
}
```

After loop fusion:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    // Loop 1
    // Loop 2
    // ...
}
```

In conclusion, C++ source-to-source compilers play a crucial role in optimizing C++ programs. They perform various transformations and optimizations, such as inline expansion, loop unrolling, common subexpression elimination, and loop fusion, to improve performance and efficiency. By automatically analyzing the source code, these compilers help developers unlock the full potential of their C++ applications. #C++ #optimization
