With the increasing complexity of software projects, refactoring has become a critical aspect in maintaining and improving codebases. Refactoring involves making changes to the structure and design of code without altering its functionality. To simplify this process, source-to-source compilers have emerged as powerful tools for automating code transformations. In this article, we will explore some popular C++ source-to-source compilers that can aid in refactoring efforts.

## Clang

[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) is a versatile source-to-source compiler that supports various programming languages including C++ and provides extensive tooling support. Developed as part of the LLVM project, Clang offers a sophisticated infrastructure for analyzing and transforming C++ code. Its refactoring library, called "clang-refactor", provides a collection of key transformation operations such as renaming variables, extracting methods, and converting for loops to more efficient alternatives.

```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (auto& num : numbers) {
    num *= 2;
}
```

Clang offers the ability to convert the above "for each" loop into a more traditional indexed loop structure using the `clang-refactor` command-line tool:

```
$ clang-refactor convert-for-each-loop -loop="auto& num : numbers" file.cpp
```

This will automatically refactor the code to:

```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i) {
    auto& num = numbers[i];
    num *= 2;
}
```

## ROSE Compiler

[ROSE](https://rosecompiler.org/) (Robust Optimization, Simulation, and Emulation) is an open-source source-to-source compiler infrastructure specifically designed for automated program analysis, optimization, and transformation. It supports various programming languages, including C++.

ROSE provides a rich set of APIs and tools that allow users to perform complex code transformations. Its refactoring capabilities include features such as automatic loop unrolling, loop interchange, and expression simplification.

```cpp
void squareArray(int* arr, int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        arr[i] = arr[i] * arr[i];
    }
}
```

ROSE provides an API that enables automatic loop unrolling:

```cpp
#include "rose.h"

void squareArray(int* arr, int size) {
    SgUnrollLoopTransformation unroller;
    SgProject* project = frontend(1, argv);
    SgSourceFile* file = isSgSourceFile(isSgProject(project)->get_fileList()[0]);
    SgFunctionDefinition* funcDef = getFirstFunctionDefinition(file);
    SgForStatement* forLoop = isSgForStatement(getFirstStatement(funcDef));
    SgForStatement* unrolledLoop = unroller.unroll(forLoop, 4);
    replaceStatement(forLoop, unrolledLoop);
}
```

## Conclusion

C++ source-to-source compilers like Clang and ROSE provide powerful means to automate code refactoring tasks. These compilers offer tools and APIs that enable developers to perform complex transformations on their codebase, saving time and effort. Whether you need to rename variables, extract methods, or optimize loops, these compilers can help streamline your refactoring process. Embrace these tools to improve the maintainability and efficiency of your C++ code.
