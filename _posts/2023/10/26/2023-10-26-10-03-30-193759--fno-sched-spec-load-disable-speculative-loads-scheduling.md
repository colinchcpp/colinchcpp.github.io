In certain situations, the compiler may perform speculative loads to optimize the execution of a program. Speculative loads enable the processor to fetch and execute instructions in advance, improving the overall performance of the code. However, there may be cases where you want to disable this feature to fine-tune the behavior of your program.

To disable speculative loads scheduling in the compiler, you can use the `-fno-sched-spec-load` flag. This flag instructs the compiler to suppress the speculative loads optimization, ensuring that instructions are executed in the original program order.

Here's an example of using the `-fno-sched-spec-load` flag with GCC:

```c
gcc -fno-sched-spec-load myprogram.c -o myprogram
```

By using this flag, you can control the behavior of the compiler and limit the speculative load optimizations. This can be useful in debugging scenarios or when you want to ensure strict adherence to the program order.

It's important to note that disabling speculative loads scheduling might impact the overall performance of your program, as this optimization is designed to improve execution time. Therefore, it is recommended to only use this flag when necessary and measure the impact on your specific use case.

For more information on compiler flags and optimizations, you can refer to the [GCC documentation](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html).

Remember to experiment, measure, and evaluate the impact of using `-fno-sched-spec-load` in your code to make informed decisions about the optimizations that suit your specific needs.
