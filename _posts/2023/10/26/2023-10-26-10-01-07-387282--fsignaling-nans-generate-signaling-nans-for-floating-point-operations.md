The `-fsignaling-nans` option is a compiler flag that can be used to generate signaling NaNs (Not-a-Number) for floating-point operations in C/C++ programs. NaNs are typically used to represent the result of undefined or invalid operations in floating-point calculations.

Signaling NaNs are a specific type of NaN that can be used to trigger an exception when encountered during computation. They can help in identifying and debugging potential issues or errors in floating-point calculations.

To enable the usage of signaling NaNs, you can add the `-fsignaling-nans` flag when compiling your C/C++ code. Here's an example:

```c
gcc -fsignaling-nans mycode.c -o mybinary
```

By enabling this option, the generated binary will produce signaling NaNs whenever an invalid operation occurs. If a signaling NaN is encountered during the execution of the program, it can trigger a floating-point exception, providing an opportunity to handle or diagnose the issue.

It's worth noting that the behavior of signaling NaNs may vary depending on the compiler and platform you are using. Therefore, it's important to refer to the documentation specific to your compiler for detailed information on how signaling NaNs are handled.

Using the `-fsignaling-nans` option can be beneficial in scenarios where you want to detect and handle floating-point errors more explicitly. However, it's important to exercise caution and ensure that the code is properly handling exceptions and fallbacks to prevent unexpected program termination.

Keep in mind that enabling signaling NaNs may impact the performance of your code, as it adds additional checks and exception handling to floating-point operations. Therefore, it's recommended to use this option primarily in debug or diagnostic scenarios rather than in performance-critical production code.

For more information on floating-point operations and the `-fsignaling-nans` option, refer to the documentation of your compiler:

- [GCC documentation on `-fsignaling-nans`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html)
- [Clang documentation on `-fsignaling-nans`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#id127)
