During the optimization process, the GCC compiler performs various transformations on the code to improve its performance. One of these transformations is renaming tree expressions, which is enabled by default. However, in some cases, you may want to disable this optimization for debugging or analysis purposes.

To disable renaming tree expressions during optimization, you can use the `-fno-tree-copyrename` flag when invoking GCC. This flag instructs the compiler to preserve the original names of the tree expressions, making it easier to understand the generated code.

Here's an example of how to use the `-fno-tree-copyrename` flag in a C program:

```c
gcc -fno-tree-copyrename myprogram.c -o myprogram
```

By applying this flag, the compiler will refrain from renaming tree expressions during the optimization process and generate code that better reflects the original source code.

It is important to note that disabling renaming tree expressions may impact the overall performance of the optimized code. The renaming optimization is designed to improve the efficiency of memory accesses and expression evaluation. Therefore, it is generally recommended to enable this optimization unless there is a specific need to disable it.

To learn more about the `-fno-tree-copyrename` flag and other optimization options, you can refer to the [GCC documentation](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html).
