When compiling code, the compiler usually applies an optimization technique called instruction reordering, which can improve performance by rearranging the order of instructions at the top level of a program. However, in some cases, we might want to disable this optimization to maintain the original order of instructions.

To disable the reordering of toplevel instructions, we can use the `-fno-toplevel-reorder` flag when compiling our code. This flag tells the compiler not to reorder the instructions at the top level.

Here's an example of how to use the flag in the command line:

```bash
gcc -fno-toplevel-reorder source.c -o output
```

In the above example, we are compiling a C source file `source.c` and using the `-fno-toplevel-reorder` flag to disable instruction reordering. The compiled executable will be named `output`.

By using this flag, we ensure that the order of instructions in the original code is preserved during compilation. This can be useful in cases where the order of instructions is important for specific functionalities or when debugging.

It's worth noting that disabling instruction reordering may impact the performance optimizations performed by the compiler. Therefore, it should be used judiciously, and its impact on performance should be carefully evaluated.
