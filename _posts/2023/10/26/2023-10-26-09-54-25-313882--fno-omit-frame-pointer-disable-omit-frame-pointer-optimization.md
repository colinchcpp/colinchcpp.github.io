Frame pointer optimization is a common optimization technique used by compilers to improve the performance of programs. However, in some cases, it may be necessary to disable this optimization for debugging or profiling purposes.

In the case of GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), the `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` flag can be used to disable the omit frame pointer optimization. This flag tells the compiler to preserve the frame pointer, which can make debugging and profiling easier.

To disable omit frame pointer optimization with GCC, simply add the `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` flag to your compilation command:

```shell
$ gcc -fno-omit-frame-pointer -o myprogram myprogram.c
```

By including this flag, the compiler will generate code that includes the frame pointer information, allowing it to be used by debuggers and profilers.

It's important to note that disabling the omit frame pointer optimization may result in slightly slower code execution. However, the benefits of easier debugging and profiling may outweigh the performance impact in certain scenarios.

If you're using a different compiler, consult its documentation to find the equivalent flag or option to disable omit frame pointer optimization.

Overall, the `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` flag provides a useful way to disable omit frame pointer optimization with GCC, making it easier to debug and profile your code. Remember to re-enable this optimization when you're done with debugging or profiling to ensure optimal performance.

For more information, refer to the [GCC Manual](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html).
