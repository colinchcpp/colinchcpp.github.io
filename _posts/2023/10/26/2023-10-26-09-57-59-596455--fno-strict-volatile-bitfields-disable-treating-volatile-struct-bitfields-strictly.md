When working with bitfields in a struct, the `volatile` keyword can be used to indicate that the values of these bitfields can change unpredictably. By default, the behavior of volatile struct bitfields is strictly enforced, ensuring that any reads or writes to these bitfields are actually performed, even if they can be optimized out by the compiler.

However, in some cases, you may want to disable this strict behavior and allow the compiler to optimize away unnecessary operations on volatile struct bitfields. To achieve this, you can use the `-fno-strict-volatile-bitfields` flag.

Here's an example of how you can use this flag when compiling code using GCC:

```c
gcc -fno-strict-volatile-bitfields myfile.c -o myfile
```

By using this flag, you inform the compiler that it is allowed to optimize away certain operations on volatile struct bitfields if it determines that it is safe to do so.

It's important to note that disabling strict volatile struct bitfields can have implications on the behavior of your code. If you rely on these volatile bitfields for synchronization or interacting with hardware, disabling strict enforcement may result in undesired behavior.

Therefore, it is recommended to use the `-fno-strict-volatile-bitfields` flag carefully and only when you understand the implications it may have on your code.
