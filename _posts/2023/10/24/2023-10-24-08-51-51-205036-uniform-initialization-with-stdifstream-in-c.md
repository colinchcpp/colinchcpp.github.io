When working with file input/output operations in C++, `std::ifstream` is commonly used to read data from a file. In modern C++, you can utilize uniform initialization syntax to create and open an `std::ifstream` object in a more concise and readable way. 

Uniform initialization was introduced in C++11 and allows you to initialize objects using curly braces `{}` or `=` syntax. This syntax can be applied to various types, including `std::ifstream`.

Here's an example of how you can use uniform initialization with `std::ifstream` to open a file for reading:

```cpp
std::ifstream file{ "filename.txt" };
```

In the above code, we create an instance of `std::ifstream` named `file` and initialize it with the filename "filename.txt". The file is then automatically opened for reading.

Uniform initialization syntax provides a more consistent and intuitive way to initialize objects in C++. It can be used not only with `std::ifstream` but also with other types and containers.

It's worth noting that uniform initialization will automatically handle the opening of the file, so you don't need to explicitly call a separate `open()` function. Additionally, if the file cannot be opened, the `std::ifstream` object will be in a failed state, which you can check using the `is_open()` or `good()` member functions.

Uniform initialization with `std::ifstream` simplifies the code and makes it easier to read and maintain. It is a helpful feature introduced in C++11 that you can take advantage of to improve your file input/output operations.

For more information on `std::ifstream` and file I/O in C++, refer to the [C++ reference documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ifstream).
