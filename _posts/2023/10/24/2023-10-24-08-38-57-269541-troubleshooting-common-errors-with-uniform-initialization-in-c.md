Uniform initialization introduced in C++11 provides a concise and consistent syntax for initializing objects. However, there are some common errors that programmers may encounter when using uniform initialization. In this blog post, we will explore these errors and provide troubleshooting strategies.

## Error: narrowing conversion

One common error that can occur when using uniform initialization is a narrowing conversion error. This happens when you try to initialize a variable with a value that cannot be safely converted to its type. For example:

```cpp
int myInt{ 3.14 }; // narrowing conversion from double to int
```

When compiling this code, the compiler will produce an error indicating that there is a narrowing conversion. To fix this error, you can either change the type of the variable or use a different form of initialization that allows implicit conversions.

If you need to perform a narrowing conversion intentionally, you can use a static_cast to explicitly indicate your intention:

```cpp
int myInt = static_cast<int>(3.14);
```

## Error: ambiguous function call

Another error that can occur with uniform initialization is an ambiguous function call error. This happens when there are multiple overloaded functions that can be called with the provided arguments. For example:

```cpp
void print(int);
void print(double);

print(3.14); // ambiguous function call
```

In this case, the compiler will produce an error indicating that the function call is ambiguous. To resolve this error, you can use explicit type casting to specify which function you want to call:

```cpp
print(static_cast<double>(3.14));
```

Alternatively, you can use the traditional function call syntax to avoid the ambiguity:

```cpp
print(double{ 3.14 });
```

## Conclusion

Uniform initialization in C++ provides a convenient and consistent syntax for initializing objects. However, it is important to be aware of the common errors that can occur when using this feature. By understanding these errors and applying the appropriate troubleshooting strategies, you can effectively address any issues that arise during the development process.
