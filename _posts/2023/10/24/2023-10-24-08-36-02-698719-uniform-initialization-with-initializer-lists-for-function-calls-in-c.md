## Introduction to Uniform Initialization
Uniform initialization provides a consistent syntax for initializing objects in C++. It allows us to initialize objects using curly braces `{}`, enabling us to achieve a more uniform way of initialization across different types.

## Initializer Lists for Function Calls
Initializer lists can also be used for function calls. Before C++11, we could pass parameters to functions either by positional order or by using named arguments. With C++11 and uniform initialization, we can pass parameters using initializer lists, making it much more intuitive and consistent.

To use initializer lists for function calls, we simply need to enclose the arguments in curly braces. This way, we can directly pass an initialized list to a function as its parameter.

## Benefits of Using Initializer Lists
Using initializer lists for function calls offers several benefits:

1. **Improved Readability**: By using initializer lists, the code becomes more readable, as the function call parameters are explicitly shown within the braces, making it clear what values are being passed.

2. **Consistency**: Since initializer lists are part of uniform initialization, using them for function calls ensures consistency in the codebase, making it easier to understand and maintain.

3. **Flexibility**: Initializer lists allow for more flexibility in function calls, as we can pass multiple values of different types, even user-defined objects, as a single argument.

4. **Avoidance of the Most Vexing Parse**: By using initializer lists, we can avoid the ambiguity that arises when a function call is mistakenly interpreted as a declaration.

## Examples
Let's consider a simple example where we have a function that takes two integers as parameters and prints their sum:

```cpp
void printSum(int a, int b) {
    int sum = a + b;
    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
}
```

We can call this function using initializer lists as follows:

```cpp
printSum({2, 3});
```

In addition to primitive types, we can also use initializer lists to pass values of user-defined objects as function parameters. Consider the following example:

```cpp
class Point {
public:
    int x;
    int y;
    
    Point(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}
};

void printPoint(const Point& point) {
    std::cout << "Point: (" << point.x << ", " << point.y << ")" << std::endl;
}
```

We can create a `Point` object using initializer lists and pass it to the `printPoint` function:

```cpp
printPoint({5, 8});
```

## Conclusion
Uniform initialization with initializer lists not only simplifies object initialization but also extends its benefits to function calls in C++. Leveraging this feature improves code readability, consistency, and flexibility while also helping to avoid potential pitfalls. By adopting uniform initialization, we can write cleaner and more maintainable code.
