In C++, member functions can also be initialized using uniform initialization syntax. This allows for a more uniform and consistent way of initializing both data members and member functions. Prior to C++11, member functions were typically defined outside the class declaration and initialized separately. However, with the introduction of uniform initialization, member functions can now be defined and initialized directly within the class declaration.

Let's take a look at an example:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    void myFunction() {
        // function implementation
    }
};
```

In the above code snippet, `myFunction` is defined and implemented within the class `MyClass`. To initialize `myFunction` using uniform initialization, we can use the following syntax:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    void myFunction() {
        // function implementation
    }
} myObject;
```

By adding `myObject` at the end of the class declaration, we are initializing an instance of `MyClass` while also defining and initializing `myFunction`.

This approach provides a more concise and readable way of initializing member functions, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

Uniform initialization can also be used when initializing member function pointers. Here's an example:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    void myFunction() {
        // function implementation
    }
};

typedef void (MyClass::*MemberFunctionPtr)();

int main() {
    MyClass myObject;
    MemberFunctionPtr ptr = &MyClass::myFunction;
    
    // Invoke member function using the pointer
    (myObject.*ptr)();

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we define a member function pointer `ptr` and initialize it with the address of `myFunction`. We can then use the pointer to invoke the member function through an object of `MyClass`.

In summary, initializing member functions using uniform initialization in C++ provides a more consistent and readable way of defining and initializing member functions directly within the class declaration. It helps improve code organization and maintainability.
