In modern C++, the introduction of the `std::filesystem` library in the Standard Library has greatly simplified file and directory operations. One of the features that enhances code clarity and simplicity is the uniform initialization syntax supported by `std::filesystem`. In this blog post, we will explore how to utilize uniform initialization for various `std::filesystem` objects.

## Using Uniform Initialization

Uniform initialization allows us to initialize `std::filesystem` objects without explicitly calling their constructors. Instead, we can use curly braces `{}` to initialize them in a more concise and readable manner. Let's look at some examples.

### Example 1: Initializing `std::filesystem::path`

The `std::filesystem::path` class represents a file or directory path. We can initialize it using uniform initialization as follows:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>

int main() {
    std::filesystem::path filePath{"path/to/file.txt"};
    std::filesystem::path directoryPath{"path/to/directory"};

    // Use the initialized file and directory paths here
}
```

With uniform initialization, we can directly specify the path as a string within curly braces, avoiding the need for explicit constructor calls.

### Example 2: Initializing `std::filesystem::directory_entry`

The `std::filesystem::directory_entry` class represents a directory entry, which can be a file or a directory. We can initialize it using uniform initialization as shown below:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>

int main() {
    std::filesystem::directory_entry fileEntry{"path/to/file.txt"};
    std::filesystem::directory_entry directoryEntry{"path/to/directory"};

    // Use the initialized file and directory entries here
}
```

Using uniform initialization, we can provide the path directly as a string within curly braces, simplifying the initialization process.

### Example 3: Initializing `std::filesystem::directory_iterator`

The `std::filesystem::directory_iterator` class allows us to iterate over the contents of a directory. We can initialize it using uniform initialization as demonstrated below:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>

int main() {
    std::filesystem::directory_iterator directoryIterator{"path/to/directory"};

    // Iterate over the contents of the directory using the initialized iterator
    for (const auto& entry : directoryIterator) {
        // Process each entry
    }
}
```

Uniform initialization enables us to initialize `std::filesystem::directory_iterator` directly with the path of the directory, making the code more concise and readable.

## Conclusion

Uniform initialization with `std::filesystem` brings a more convenient and readable syntax for initializing common objects like `std::filesystem::path`, `std::filesystem::directory_entry`, and `std::filesystem::directory_iterator`. By leveraging this feature, we can simplify our code and enhance its clarity. So the next time you work with `std::filesystem`, consider using uniform initialization for a more modern and concise coding style.
