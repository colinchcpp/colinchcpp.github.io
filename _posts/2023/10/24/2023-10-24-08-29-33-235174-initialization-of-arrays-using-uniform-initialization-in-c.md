Arrays are an essential data structure in programming, used to store a collection of elements of the same type. In C++, there are multiple ways to initialize an array. One of the modern and convenient methods is using uniform initialization.

Uniform initialization was introduced in C++11 and provides a concise and consistent way to initialize arrays. It uses braces `{}` to enclose the elements of the array, allowing initialization of arrays with a comma-separated list of values.

Here's an example of how to initialize an array using uniform initialization in C++:

```cpp
int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

In the above code snippet, an integer array named `numbers` is declared and initialized using uniform initialization. The array contains the values `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` in that order.

It's important to note that when using uniform initialization, the size of the array is automatically determined based on the number of elements provided in the initializer list.

We can also initialize arrays of other types using uniform initialization. For example, consider the following code snippet:

```cpp
char vowels[] = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
```

In this case, a character array named `vowels` is initialized with the values `'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'`. Again, the size of the array is automatically determined based on the number of elements in the initializer list.

Uniform initialization can also be used to initialize arrays of user-defined types or even arrays of arrays.

In conclusion, uniform initialization provides a convenient and concise way to initialize arrays in C++. It allows you to declare and initialize arrays in a single line of code, making your code more readable and maintainable.
