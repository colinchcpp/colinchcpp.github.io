To initialize a `std::deque` using uniform initialization, you can make use of the brace initialization syntax {} introduced in C++11. Here's an example:

```cpp
std::deque<int> myDeque = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initialize with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

In the above code snippet, we declare a `std::deque` called `myDeque` and initialize it with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 using uniform initialization syntax. This initializes the `std::deque` with the provided elements in sequential order.

Uniform initialization not only allows you to initialize the `std::deque` with explicit values but also works for initializing with default values or empty initialization:

```cpp
std::deque<int> emptyDeque{}; // Initialize an empty deque

std::deque<std::string> defaultInitializedDeque(5); // Initialize deque with five default-constructed elements
```

In the first example, an empty `std::deque` called `emptyDeque` is initialized using the empty curly braces {}.

In the second example, a `std::deque` called `defaultInitializedDeque` is initialized with five default-constructed elements. The size of the deque is specified within the parentheses, and each element is default-initialized.

Uniform initialization improves code clarity and allows for consistent initialization syntax across different types of initialization. It is a modern and preferred method of initializing containers, including `std::deque`, in C++. Embrace this feature to make your code more readable and maintainable.
