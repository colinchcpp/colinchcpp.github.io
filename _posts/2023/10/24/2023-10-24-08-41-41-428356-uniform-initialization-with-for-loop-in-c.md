In C++, you can use uniform initialization syntax to initialize variables in a concise and readable way. This syntax allows you to define variables and provide their initial values directly within the declaration statement. Besides its general usage, uniform initialization can also be combined with a for loop to initialize a range of variables efficiently. Let's explore how this can be achieved.

## Basic For Loop Initialization
Before diving into uniform initialization, let's first review the basic syntax of a for loop in C++.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // loop body
}
```

In this example, `i` is initialized to 0, and the loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`. After each iteration, the loop increments `i` by 1.

## Uniform Initialization in For Loop
To use uniform initialization to initialize a range of variables within a for loop, you can leverage the power of the auto keyword combined with the `{}` initializer syntax.

```cpp
for (auto i = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; const auto& value : i) {
    // loop body
}
```

In this case, the `auto` keyword deduces the type of the variable `i` as an initializer list. The `{}` syntax is used to specify the initial values. The for loop iterates over each element of `i`, and the `const auto& value` assigns the current element to `value`.

## Example: Sum of Array Elements
Let's look at an example that illustrates the usage of uniform initialization in a for loop.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int total = 0;

    for (auto arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; const auto& element : arr) {
        total += element;
    }

    std::cout << "Sum of array elements: " << total << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the for loop initializes `arr` with the values `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`. The loop iterates over each element of `arr` and adds it to the `total` variable. Finally, the sum of the array elements is displayed.

## Benefits of Uniform Initialization in For Loop
Using uniform initialization in a for loop offers several benefits:

1. **Readability**: It provides a more readable and concise syntax for initializing variables within a loop.
2. **Type Safety**: The `auto` keyword ensures that the type of the variable is deduced correctly based on the initialization values.
3. **Flexibility**: You can easily modify the initial values by updating the initializer list within the curly braces.

## Conclusion
Uniform initialization combined with a for loop in C++ allows you to initialize a range of variables efficiently and concisely. It improves code readability and provides type safety. By leveraging the power of the auto keyword and initializer list syntax, you can simplify your code and make it more maintainable. Give it a try in your next C++ project!
