In modern C++, uniform initialization syntax can be used to create and initialize objects using braces ({}) instead of traditional constructor syntax. This syntax is concise and also applies to smart pointers like `std::shared_ptr`. In this article, we will explore how to use uniform initialization with `std::shared_ptr` in C++.

## Initializing `std::shared_ptr` with uniform initialization

To initialize a `std::shared_ptr` using uniform initialization, you can simply enclose the object you want to manage in braces and pass it as an argument to the constructor. Consider the following example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        std::cout << "MyClass Constructor" << std::endl;
    }
    
    ~MyClass() {
        std::cout << "MyClass Destructor" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::shared_ptr<MyClass> ptr{new MyClass()};
    
    // Accessing the managed object
    ptr->doSomething();
    
    // The destructor will be called automatically
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we are creating a `std::shared_ptr` named `ptr` using uniform initialization. We pass a new instance of `MyClass` enclosed in braces as an argument to the `std::shared_ptr` constructor. The managed object will be automatically deleted when it's no longer referenced.

## Benefits of using uniform initialization with `std::shared_ptr`

Using uniform initialization with `std::shared_ptr` offers several benefits:

1. **Clarity and readability**: The use of braces to initialize `std::shared_ptr` makes the initialization syntax clearer and more consistent with other types of objects.
2. **Avoiding ambiguity**: Uniform initialization explicitly shows that you are initializing a `std::shared_ptr` and not attempting to perform other operations like assignment.
3. **Consistent with modern C++**: Uniform initialization is a feature introduced in C++11, and using it with `std::shared_ptr` follows the modern C++ programming style.

## Conclusion

Uniform initialization provides a concise and clear way to initialize `std::shared_ptr` objects in C++. It enhances code readability and ensures that you are explicitly initializing a `std::shared_ptr`. By using uniform initialization, you can leverage the benefits of modern C++ and write cleaner code.
