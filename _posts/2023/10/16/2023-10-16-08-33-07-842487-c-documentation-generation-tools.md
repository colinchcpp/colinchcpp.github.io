When working on a C++ project, documenting your code is crucial for both internal understanding and collaboration with other developers. It not only helps you keep track of the codebase but also makes it easier for new team members to get up to speed. In this blog post, we will explore some popular documentation generation tools for C++.

## <a name="doxygen"></a>Doxygen

Doxygen is one of the most widely used documentation generation tools for C++. It supports a variety of programming languages and can generate documentation in multiple formats such as HTML, LaTeX, and PDF.

To use Doxygen, you simply need to write comments in your code using a specific format. It supports documenting classes, functions, variables, and more. Doxygen also provides support for generating call graphs, class hierarchy diagrams, and collaboration diagrams.

To generate documentation using Doxygen, you need to run the `doxygen` command in the project directory. This will generate the documentation based on the configuration file (`Doxyfile`) in the project.

Doxygen offers several configuration options to customize the generated documentation according to your project's requirements. It also supports integrating with version control systems to automatically update the documentation when the codebase changes.

## <a name="sphinx"></a>Sphinx

Sphinx is another popular documentation generation tool commonly used with C++. Originally designed for Python, Sphinx supports many other programming languages, including C++. It generates documentation in multiple formats, including HTML and PDF.

Sphinx uses reStructuredText format for writing documentation, which provides a simple and readable markup language. It allows you to add headings, code blocks, cross-references, and more. With Sphinx, you can generate API documentation, tutorials, and even complete project documentation.

To use Sphinx for C++ documentation, you need to configure the `conf.py` file, which contains project-specific settings and options. You can customize the appearance, structure, and behavior of the generated documentation using various extensions and themes.

Sphinx also integrates well with version control systems and offers support for internationalization, allowing you to generate documentation in multiple languages.

## <a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion

Having well-documented code is essential for maintaining a clean and understandable codebase. Both Doxygen and Sphinx are powerful documentation generation tools that can help you easily generate professional-looking documentation for your C++ projects.

While Doxygen is mainly focused on C++ and offers more advanced features for documenting code, Sphinx provides a more versatile and extensible documentation framework suitable for various programming languages.

It's worth noting that these tools are just a starting point, and there are other documentation generation tools like DocFX and MkDocs that you can explore based on your specific needs.
