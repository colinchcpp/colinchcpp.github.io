Documenting your C++ code is essential for maintaining and sharing your codebase. It helps other developers understand how to use your code effectively. Additionally, documenting your APIs makes it easier for developers to integrate your code into their projects. In this blog post, we will explore some popular tools for C++ code documentation and API documentation.

## Table of Contents
- [Doxygen](#doxygen)
- [Sphinx](#sphinx)

## Doxygen

Doxygen is a widely used documentation tool for C++ code. It supports various programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python. Doxygen generates documentation from specially formatted comments within the code, allowing you to easily maintain the documentation within your source code.

To use Doxygen, you need to add special comments to your code, starting with `/**` or `///`. These comments should describe the purpose of classes, functions, and variables, as well as provide examples and usage instructions. Doxygen uses these comments to generate a detailed documentation website, including class hierarchies, function references, and even UML diagrams.

Doxygen also supports generating documentation in multiple output formats, such as HTML, PDF, and LaTeX. This flexibility enables you to publish your documentation in different formats as per your needs.

Doxygen Example:

```cpp
/**
 * @brief This is a sample function that adds two numbers.
 *
 * @param a The first number.
 * @param b The second number.
 * @return The sum of the two numbers.
 */
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## Sphinx

Sphinx is another powerful documentation tool that can be used for documenting C++ code as well as other programming languages. It supports a wide range of output formats, including HTML, PDF, and ePub. Sphinx uses reStructuredText, a lightweight markup language, for writing documentation.

Sphinx has excellent integration with the C++ programming language through the Breathe extension. Breathe allows you to parse Doxygen-generated XML files and incorporate them into your Sphinx documentation. This combination provides the best of both worlds â€“ the powerful C++ code parsing capabilities of Doxygen and the flexible documentation language of reStructuredText.

Sphinx Example:

```cpp
.. cpp:function:: int add(int a, int b)
   :noindex:

   This is a sample function that adds two numbers.

   :param a: The first number.
   :type a: int
   :param b: The second number.
   :type b: int
   :return: The sum of the two numbers.
   :rtype: int
```

## Conclusion

Proper documentation is crucial for maintaining and sharing your C++ codebase. Doxygen and Sphinx are excellent choices for generating comprehensive documentation for your C++ code and APIs. They provide various features and output formats, making it easier for developers to consume your documentation. Choose the tool that best fits your project requirements and start documenting your C++ code today!
