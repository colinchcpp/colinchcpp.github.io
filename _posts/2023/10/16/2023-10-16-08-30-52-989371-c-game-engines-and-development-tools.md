C++ has long been a popular programming language choice for game development due to its high performance and low-level control. Fortunately, there are several game engines and development tools available in the market that support C++. In this article, we will explore some of the top C++ game engines and development tools that can help you create stunning games.

## 1. Unreal Engine

Unreal Engine is a powerful and widely-used game engine that supports C++ development. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and features for creating high-quality games across multiple platforms, including PC, console, and mobile. Unreal Engine provides a user-friendly visual scripting system called Blueprints, but the real power lies in its C++ programming capabilities, allowing developers to build complex and performance-optimized game logic and systems.

Unreal Engine also includes a vast library of ready-to-use assets, materials, and effects, as well as a strong community support system. It is known for its stunning graphics capabilities and has been used to develop popular games like Fortnite, Gears of War, and Batman: Arkham Knight.

Unity is another leading game engine that supports C++ development alongside its own scripting language, C#. While Unity primarily promotes the use of C# for game development, it also provides a way to integrate C++ code into projects for performance-critical tasks.

Unity offers a wide range of features and tools for creating both 2D and 3D games. It provides an intuitive visual editor, a powerful animation system, and a vast asset store with thousands of ready-to-use game assets. Unity supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and web.

With its extensive documentation, tutorials, and an active community, Unity is an excellent choice for beginners as well as experienced developers.
