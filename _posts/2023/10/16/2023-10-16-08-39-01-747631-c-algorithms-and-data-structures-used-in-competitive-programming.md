## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms play a crucial role in competitive programming, as many problems require sorting elements in various orders. Here are a few commonly used sorting algorithms in competitive programming:

- **Bubble Sort:** It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort:** It selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the list and moves it to the sorted part.
- **Insertion Sort:** It builds the final sorted array one item at a time, by iterating through the array and inserting each element in its correct position.
- **Merge Sort:** It divides the unsorted list into sublists, recursively sorts them, and then merges them to produce a sorted output.
- **Quick Sort:** It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the pivot, placing elements smaller than the pivot on one side and larger on the other.

## Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms help in finding elements efficiently from a given collection of data. These are some commonly used searching algorithms in competitive programming:

- **Linear Search:** It sequentially checks every element in the list until a match is found.
- **Binary Search:** It divides the sorted list into halves, and repeatedly searches in the half that may contain the target element.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** It explores all the vertices of a graph in a breadthward motion before moving to the next level.

## Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are essential for solving problems involving networks, connectivity, and traversal. Commonly used graph algorithms in competitive programming include:

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** It finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** It finds the shortest path in a graph with negative edge weights and detects negative cycles.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** It finds the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a graph.
- **Topological Sort:** It orders the vertices of a directed acyclic graph in such a way that for every directed edge from vertex A to vertex B, A appears before B.

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique used to solve optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. Some commonly used dynamic programming algorithms in competitive programming are:

- **Fibonacci Numbers:** It calculates the nth Fibonacci number using memoization or tabulation techniques.
- **Knapsack Problem:** It solves the problem of optimizing the selection of items in a way that maximizes their total value, given a weight constraint.
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** It finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences, which may not be contiguous.
- **Coin Change Problem:** It determines the number of ways to make change for a given amount using a limited set of coin denominations.

## Data Structures

Efficient data structures are crucial in solving problems efficiently. Here are some commonly used data structures in competitive programming:

- **Array:** It is a collection of elements stored in consecutive memory locations, allowing constant time access to elements.
- **Vector:** It is a dynamic array that automatically grows when elements are added.
- **Stack:** It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and allows operations like push and pop.
- **Queue:** It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle and allows operations like enqueue and dequeue.
- **Priority Queue:** It is a queue where each element has a priority associated with it, and elements with higher priority are dequeued first.

## Conclusion

Competitive programming requires a strong understanding of algorithms and data structures. In this article, we covered some essential algorithms and data structures commonly used in competitive programming with C++. It is crucial to practice implementing and applying these concepts to solve problems efficiently. Emphasizing algorithmic thinking can greatly enhance your chances of success in competitive programming.

Remember to continuously explore and learn new algorithms and data structures as the field of competitive programming is continuously evolving.
