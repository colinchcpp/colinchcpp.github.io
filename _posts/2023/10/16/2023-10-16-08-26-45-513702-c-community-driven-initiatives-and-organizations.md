C++ is a popular programming language known for its performance, flexibility, and wide range of applications. Over the years, the C++ community has grown significantly, fostering various initiatives and organizations that contribute to the development and promotion of C++. In this article, we will explore some of these community-driven initiatives and organizations.

## 1. C++ Foundation

The C++ Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the C++ programming language. It aims to provide resources, education, and a collaborative platform for C++ developers worldwide. The foundation organizes conferences, workshops, and training programs to help developers stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in C++. They also actively engage in standardization efforts and provide support for C++ user groups.
