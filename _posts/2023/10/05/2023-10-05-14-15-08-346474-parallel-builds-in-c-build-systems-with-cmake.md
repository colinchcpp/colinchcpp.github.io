Building large C++ projects can sometimes be time-consuming, especially if you have multiple source files and dependencies. Fortunately, CMake, a popular cross-platform build system, provides the ability to parallelize the build process, allowing you to greatly reduce the build time and speed up your development workflow. In this blog post, we will explore how to enable parallel builds in CMake and discuss the benefits it brings.

## What are parallel builds?

Parallel builds, also known as parallel compilation, refers to the concept of running multiple compilation processes concurrently, utilizing multiple CPU cores or threads. Instead of compiling one source file at a time sequentially, parallel builds distribute the workload across available resources, enabling faster compilation and reducing overall build time.

## Enabling parallel builds in CMake

To enable parallel builds in CMake, you can use the `-j` option followed by the number of parallel jobs to run. This option tells CMake to distribute the build processes across multiple cores or threads, improving overall efficiency. Here's how you can use it:

```cmake
cmake --build . -- -j8
```

In the above example, `--build` is used to specify the build directory, followed by `--` to separate CMake arguments. `-j8` indicates that CMake should run up to 8 parallel jobs. You can adjust the number to match the number of CPU cores or threads available on your machine.

## Benefits of parallel builds

1. **Faster build times**: By utilizing multiple cores or threads, parallel builds can significantly speed up the compilation process, reducing overall build times. This allows for quicker feedback and iteration during the development cycle.

2. **Improved resource utilization**: Parallel builds make efficient use of available computing resources. Instead of leaving CPU cores idle while waiting for a single source file to compile, parallelization ensures that all cores are occupied, maximizing resource utilization.

3. **Scaling with larger projects**: As projects grow larger with more source files and dependencies, the benefits of parallel builds become even more pronounced. With parallelization, the build process can handle the increased workload more efficiently, resulting in faster build times.

## Conclusion

Parallel builds are a powerful technique for reducing build times and improving productivity in C++ projects. By enabling parallel builds in CMake, you can take advantage of multiple cores or threads to speed up the compilation process. This not only helps in faster development but also enhances resource utilization when building large projects. So next time you work with CMake, remember to enable parallel builds and experience the benefits firsthand!
