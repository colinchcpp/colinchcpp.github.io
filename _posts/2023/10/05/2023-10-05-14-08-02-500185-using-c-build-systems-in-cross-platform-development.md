When it comes to developing cross-platform applications using C++, having a reliable and efficient build system in place is crucial. A build system is responsible for compiling source code, linking dependencies, and generating the final executable or library for distribution.

In this blog post, we will explore some popular C++ build systems that help streamline the development process, ensure code portability, and simplify the management of project dependencies.

## 1. CMake

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is an open-source, cross-platform build system that uses a high-level scripting language to generate platform-specific build files. It allows developers to define build configurations once and generate native build files for various operating systems and IDEs, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

CMake provides a consistent and efficient way to handle complex build processes, especially when dealing with large codebases and multiple dependencies. It supports different generators like Makefile, Ninja, and Visual Studio, allowing developers to work with their preferred development tools.

To use CMake, create a `CMakeLists.txt` file in the project directory and define the source files, build targets, and project options. Then, run CMake to generate the build files specific to your target platform.

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyProject)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

# Add source files
set(SOURCES main.cpp foo.cpp bar.cpp)

# Declare the executable target
add_executable(MyExecutable ${SOURCES})
```

CMake also supports configuring project variables, finding external libraries, and integrating unit tests into the build process.

## 2. Bazel

[Bazel](https://bazel.build/) is another popular build system developed by Google. Originally tailored for large-scale, distributed projects, Bazel offers efficient and reproducible builds for C++, Java, Python, and other languages.

One of Bazel's key strengths is its ability to transparently handle the build dependencies and cache intermediate build artifacts. This makes incremental builds significantly faster and ensures consistent builds across different environments.

Bazel uses a declarative language called Starlark for build configurations. The build rules define the source files, dependencies, and build steps. Bazel also includes a powerful query language that allows developers to analyze the project structure and dependencies.

To get started with Bazel, create a `BUILD` file in the project's root directory and define the build targets and dependencies.

```python
# BUILD

cc_binary(
    name = "my_executable",
    srcs = ["main.cpp", "foo.cpp", "bar.cpp"]
)
```

Bazel provides a command-line interface to build, test, and manage your project.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right build system is essential for cross-platform C++ development. Both CMake and Bazel offer robust solutions that simplify the build process, handle dependencies, and ensure consistent builds across different platforms.

While CMake is more popular and widely adopted, Bazel's focus on scalability and performance makes it an excellent choice for large-scale projects. Evaluate your project requirements, consider the available features, and choose the build system that best suits your needs.

Remember to regularly update the build system and dependencies to leverage new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
