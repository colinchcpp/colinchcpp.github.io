When it comes to distributing C++ projects, one common approach is to provide executable binaries to end-users. These binaries allow users to run your program without the need to install additional dependencies or compile the source code themselves. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve this with the help of a Makefile.

## What is Makefile?

Makefile is a build automation tool that simplifies the process of compiling and managing projects. It defines a set of rules to build targets by specifying the prerequisites and commands necessary for their creation. By using a Makefile, you can easily distribute your C++ project as an executable binary.

## Setting up the Makefile

To get started, create a file called `Makefile` in the root directory of your C++ project. The Makefile consists of rules that define how to compile the source code and link it into an executable binary.

```make
# Define Compiler and Flags
CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++11 -Wall

# Define Source Files and Executable Name
SRCS = main.cpp utility.cpp
EXEC = myapp

# Default Rule
all: $(EXEC)

$(EXEC): $(SRCS)
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(SRCS) -o $@

clean:
	rm -f $(EXEC)
```

Let's break down the Makefile:

- `CXX` defines the compiler (in this case, `g++` is used).
- `CXXFLAGS` specify the compiler flags, such as standard version (`-std=c++11`) and warnings (`-Wall`).
- `SRCS` lists the source files required for the project (add more if necessary).
- `EXEC` is the name of the generated executable binary.
- `all` is the default rule that represents the target to be built (in this case, the executable binary).
- `$(EXEC): $(SRCS)` indicates that the executable depends on the source files.
- `$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(SRCS) -o $@` is the command to compile the source files and create the executable.
- `clean` is a rule to remove the executable when no longer needed.

## Building the project

To build your C++ project, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory, and run the following command:

```bash
make
```

The Makefile will compile the source files, link them together, and generate an executable binary named `myapp`.

## Distributing the executable binary

Now that you have generated the executable binary, you can distribute it to end-users. Simply provide them with the binary file (`myapp` in this example) along with any necessary documentation or resources.

End-users can execute the program by navigating to the directory where the binary is located, opening a terminal or command prompt, and running the following command:

```bash
./myapp
```

## Conclusion

Using a Makefile to distribute C++ projects as executable binaries simplifies the process for end-users. It eliminates the need for them to install dependencies or compile the source code themselves. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily create and distribute your C++ projects as executable binaries using a Makefile.
