When working on C++ projects, having a reliable and flexible build system is crucial. Makefile is a popular build tool that allows you to define build targets and their dependencies. In this blog post, we will learn how to configure C++ build targets using Makefile.

## Basic Makefile Structure

A Makefile consists of rules that define how to build different targets. Each rule follows the format:

```makefile
target: dependencies
	recipe
```

The target is the name of the file or action to be built, and dependencies are the files or actions that the target depends on. The recipe is a set of commands to be executed to build the target.

## Configuring C++ Compilation

To configure C++ compilation in your Makefile, you need to specify the compiler and the flags to be used. For example, to use the GCC compiler with the `-std=c++17` flag, you can add the following lines to your Makefile:

```makefile
CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++17
```

The `CXX` variable specifies the compiler, and the `CXXFLAGS` variable defines the compilation flags.

## Creating Build Targets

To create a build target for your C++ source file, you need to define a rule in your Makefile. Let's assume you have a `main.cpp` file that you want to compile into an executable named `myprogram`. Here's how you can define the rule:

```makefile
myprogram: main.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) main.cpp -o myprogram
```

In this example, `myprogram` is the target, and `main.cpp` is its dependency. The recipe invokes the compiler (`$(CXX)`) with the specified flags (`$(CXXFLAGS)`), the source file (`main.cpp`), and the output file (`-o myprogram`).

You can add as many build targets as you want, each with its own set of dependencies and recipe.

## Setting Dependencies

Makefile allows you to define dependencies between targets. For example, let's say that your `myprogram` target depends on another target named `utils`. You can express this dependency as follows:

```makefile
myprogram: main.cpp utils
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) main.cpp -o myprogram

utils: utils.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) utils.cpp -o utils
```

In this case, `myprogram` depends on both `main.cpp` and `utils` targets. When you run `make myprogram`, Makefile will ensure that `utils` is built first if it's not up to date.

## Conclusion

Makefile provides a flexible and powerful way to configure C++ build targets. By defining rules, dependencies, and recipes, you can easily compile your C++ source code into executables. With this knowledge, you can now create Makefiles to manage your C++ projects efficiently.

Remember to be consistent with your syntax and naming conventions in order to have a well-structured Makefile that can handle complex build scenarios.
