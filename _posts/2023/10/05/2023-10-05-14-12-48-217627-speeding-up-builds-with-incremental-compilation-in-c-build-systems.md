Building large C++ projects can sometimes be time-consuming, especially when the entire codebase is recompiled for each change made. This can significantly slow down the development process and lead to frustration. Thankfully, many modern C++ build systems provide a feature called "incremental compilation" that can help speed up builds by only recompiling the necessary parts of the codebase.

## What is incremental compilation?

Incremental compilation is a technique used in build systems to only compile the source files that have changed since the last build. Instead of recompiling the entire project, the build system analyzes dependencies and intelligently determines which files need to be compiled.

## Benefits of incremental compilation

Implementing incremental compilation in your C++ build system can bring several benefits:

1. **Faster build times:** By only compiling modified files, the build system can significantly reduce build times, especially for larger projects.

2. **Improved developer productivity:** With faster build times, developers can quickly iterate on their code, leading to increased productivity and a smoother development experience.

3. **Reduced resource usage:** Since only a subset of files needs to be compiled, incremental compilation reduces resource usage, such as CPU and memory, during the build process.

## How to enable incremental compilation

The process of enabling incremental compilation might vary depending on your chosen C++ build system. Here, we'll briefly discuss how to enable incremental compilation in two popular build systems: CMake and Make.

### CMake

To enable incremental compilation in CMake, you can set the `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` variable to `YES` in your `CMakeLists.txt` file. This generates a `compile_commands.json` file that contains the necessary information for incremental compilation.

You can then use a build tool like Ninja to take advantage of the compiled_commands.json file. Ninja can efficiently determine which files need recompilation based on the modified files.

### Make

In Make, you can utilize dependency tracking to achieve incremental compilation. By correctly setting up the dependencies between source files, Make can determine which files are in need of recompilation.

To enable dependency tracking, you'll need to specify the dependencies explicitly using special rules in your Makefile. This ensures that Make only rebuilds files that have changed or have dependencies on modified files.

## Conclusion

Enabling incremental compilation in your C++ build system can greatly improve build times, leading to faster development cycles and increased productivity. Whether you're using CMake or Make, taking advantage of this feature can help optimize the build process for your C++ projects.

By implementing incremental compilation, you can speed up your builds, reduce resource usage, and create a more efficient development workflow. So why not give it a try and see the positive impact it can have on your C++ projects?
