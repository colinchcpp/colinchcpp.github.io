Build systems are an essential part of the software development process. They automate the compilation, linking, and building of the code into an executable or a library. In C++ build systems, the concept of build targets plays a crucial role in defining what needs to be built and how it should be built.

## What are build targets?

In the context of a build system, a **build target** represents a specific output produced by the build process. It can be an executable, a shared library, a static library, or any other artifact that needs to be generated.

Build targets are typically defined in a configuration file, such as a **CMakeLists.txt** file in CMake or a **Makefile** in traditional make build systems. These configuration files specify the dependencies, compilation flags, and other instructions required to build the target.

## Working with build targets

When working with a C++ build system, you will encounter various build targets. Let's take a look at some common types of build targets:

### 1. Executables
An executable target represents a program that can be executed directly. It is usually the main output of the build process. For example, if you are building a command-line tool, the resulting executable would be the build target.

### 2. Shared Libraries
Shared libraries, also known as dynamic link libraries (DLL) in some platforms, are reusable code components that can be dynamically linked at runtime. They are useful when multiple executables need to use the same code. Build systems allow you to create build targets for shared libraries.

### 3. Static Libraries
Static libraries are collections of object code that are statically linked into an executable during the build process. This means that the code from the static library becomes a part of the final executable. Static libraries are useful when you want to distribute code as a single executable file, without any external dependencies.

### 4. Object Files
Object files are intermediate build targets produced during the compilation process. They contain machine code specific to a particular source file. Object files are then linked together to create the final executable or library.

## Why are build targets important?

Build targets are important because they allow you to build different parts of your project individually. This can be useful in the following scenarios:

- **Incremental Builds**: By building only the necessary build targets, you can save compilation time and improve productivity. If you make changes to a specific source file, the build system can determine which build targets need to be rebuilt based on their dependencies.
  
- **Selective Builds**: Sometimes you may only want to build a specific component of your project, such as an executable or a library. By specifying the desired build target, the build system will only build that particular component.

- **Dependency Management**: Build targets help manage dependencies between different components of your project. If one build target depends on another, the build system can ensure that dependencies are built in the correct order.

In conclusion, build targets are a fundamental concept in C++ build systems. They define what needs to be built, how it should be built, and allow for efficient and selective builds. Understanding and effectively working with build targets is essential for optimizing the build process and managing project dependencies.
