If you have been working with C or C++ projects, it's very likely that you have encountered Makefiles. Makefiles are build system files that automate the compilation process and manage dependencies between source files. However, as projects grow larger and more complex, Makefiles can become difficult to maintain.

CMake is an open-source build system that provides a more scalable and maintainable alternative to Makefiles. It offers a higher-level abstraction and makes it easier to manage dependencies, generate build files for different platforms and compilers, and integrate with IDEs and other tools.

In this blog post, we will discuss the steps involved in migrating from a Makefile-based project to CMake. Let's get started!

## What is CMake? {#what-is-cmake}
CMake is an open-source build system that generates platform-specific build files (Makefiles, Visual Studio project files, etc.) based on an abstract build description specified in text files called CMakeLists.txt. It provides a simple and unified way to manage the entire build process.

## Benefits of using CMake {#benefits-of-using-cmake}
There are several benefits to using CMake over Makefiles:

- **Platform independence**: CMake can generate build files for different platforms and compilers, ensuring portability of your project.
- **Simplified build process**: CMake offers a higher-level abstraction and simplifies the declaration of targets, dependencies, and build options.
- **Integration with IDEs**: CMake can generate project files for popular IDEs like Visual Studio, Xcode, and Eclipse, making it easier to work with your codebase in your preferred development environment.
- **Module-based architecture**: CMake allows you to organize your project into modules, making it easier to manage dependencies and reuse code.

## Migrating from Makefile to CMake {#migrating-from-makefile-to-cmake}
Now, let's go through the steps involved in migrating from a Makefile-based project to a CMake-based project.
  
### Step 1: Setting up CMakeLists.txt {#step-1-setting-up-cmakeliststxt}
The first step is to create a CMakeLists.txt file in the root directory of your project. This file will serve as the entry point for CMake and will contain the build configuration for your project.

### Step 2: Defining targets and dependencies {#step-2-defining-targets-and-dependencies}
In the CMakeLists.txt file, you need to define the targets for your project. Targets can be executables, libraries, or custom build steps. You will also specify the source files for each target and any dependencies they have on other targets or external libraries.

### Step 3: Handling compiler flags and options {#step-3-handling-compiler-flags-and-options}
CMake provides a way to set compiler flags and options for your project. You can specify different flags for different build types (debug, release, etc.). This allows you to control the compilation process more flexibly compared to a Makefile.

### Step 4: Configuring installation and packaging {#step-4-configuring-installation-and-packaging}
CMake allows you to specify how your project should be installed on the target system, including the destination directories for binaries, libraries, and headers. You can also define installation rules for other files such as documentation or configuration files. Additionally, CMake supports packaging your project into distributable formats like tarballs or installers.

### Step 5: Generating build files {#step-5-generating-build-files}
Once you have set up the CMakeLists.txt file, you can generate platform-specific build files using CMake. For example, on Linux, you can run `cmake .` in the project directory to generate Makefiles, and then use `make` to build the project.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}
Migrating from Makefile to CMake can bring significant benefits to your project, including improved maintainability, platform independence, and IDE integration. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you'll be able to smoothly transition your project to CMake and take advantage of its features.

Remember, CMake offers a more scalable and maintainable build system compared to traditional Makefiles. Embrace the power of CMake and streamline your project's build process!
