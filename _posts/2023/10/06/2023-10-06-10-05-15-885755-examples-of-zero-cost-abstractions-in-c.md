When programming in C++, one of the key advantages is the ability to use *zero-cost abstractions*. Zero-cost abstractions refer to language features that provide high-level abstractions without incurring any performance overhead. In other words, the abstractions come at no additional cost in terms of runtime performance. Let's take a look at some examples of zero-cost abstractions in C++. 

## 1. Templates

Templates in C++ allow for generic programming, where algorithms and data structures can operate on multiple types without sacrificing performance. The compiler generates a separate code instance for each type used with the template, ensuring type-specific optimizations. This zero-cost abstraction enables code reuse while maintaining performance.

```cpp
template<typename T>
void swap(T& a, T& b) {
    T temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```

## 2. Inline Functions

In C++, the `inline` keyword is used to suggest the compiler to replace a function call with the actual code of the function. This eliminates the overhead of the function call, resulting in improved performance. Inline functions are commonly used for small utility functions and getter/setter methods.

```cpp
inline int square(int num) {
    return num * num;
}
```

## 3. constexpr

The `constexpr` keyword allows compile-time evaluation of expressions and function calls. It enables the computation to be performed at compile-time rather than run-time, leading to optimized code. With `constexpr`, you can write complex calculations, such as factorials or Fibonacci sequences, that are evaluated during compilation.

```cpp
constexpr int factorial(int n) {
    return (n <= 1) ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

## 4. Static Polymorphism (CRTP)

The Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) is used to achieve static polymorphism in C++. It enables compile-time polymorphism without the runtime overhead of virtual function calls. By using CRTP, static dispatch is performed at compile-time, resulting in efficient code execution.

```cpp
template <typename Derived>
class Base {
public:
    void execute() {
        static_cast<Derived*>(this)->implementation();
    }
};

class Derived : public Base<Derived> {
public:
    void implementation() {
        // Implementation code
    }
};
```

In conclusion, C++ provides several zero-cost abstractions that enable high-level programming without sacrificing performance. Templates, inline functions, constexpr, and static polymorphism are just a few examples of the power and efficiency of C++ as a language.
