Animations play a crucial role in creating visually appealing and engaging experiences in various domains, including gaming, film, and interactive applications. Retargeting animation is a process that involves mapping animations from one character or skeleton to another. It allows animators to reuse existing animations on different characters or skeletons, saving valuable time and effort.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a retargeting animation system in C++ for animation tools. This system can be integrated into animation software to provide animators with an efficient retargeting solution.

### Understanding Animation Retargeting

Animation retargeting involves transferring animations from one character rig to another. The source character rig contains a hierarchy of bones, each representing a part of the character's body. The target character rig may have a different hierarchy or bone structure.

The goal of retargeting is to map the movements of each bone in the source rig to the corresponding bone in the target rig. This process ensures that the animations are correctly applied to the target character, even if the bone structures are different.

### Implementing the Retargeting System

To implement a retargeting system in C++, we can start by creating classes to represent the source and target rigs. Each class should encapsulate information about the bone hierarchy and transformation matrices.

### Mapping Bone Hierarchies

To map the bone hierarchy between the source and target rigs, we can use an algorithm such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS). This algorithm traverses the bone hierarchy of the source rig and matches each bone to the corresponding bone in the target rig based on similarity or user-defined rules.

The mapping process should handle cases where bones in the source and target rigs have different names, but are functionally equivalent. This ensures that animations are correctly retargeted even if the bone names differ between characters.

### Applying Transformation Matrices

Once we have mapped the bone hierarchy, we need to apply the transformation matrices from the source rig to the corresponding bones in the target rig. The transformation matrix represents the position, orientation, and scale of each bone at a given frame of the animation.

By applying the transformation matrices to the target rig, we can accurately simulate the movements of the source character's bones on the target character. This step is crucial to ensure that the animations look natural and realistic on different characters or skeletons.

### Interpolation and Blending

Often, animations need to be smoothly interpolated and blended to create seamless transitions between different motions. To achieve this, we can use techniques such as linear interpolation or quaternion blending.

Linear interpolation involves calculating intermediate values between keyframes to create smooth transitions. Quaternion blending, on the other hand, ensures that rotations are correctly interpolated to prevent issues like gimbal lock.

By implementing these interpolation and blending techniques, we can enhance the quality and fluidity of the retargeted animations.

### Conclusion

Retargeting animation is an essential feature in animation tools as it enables animators to reuse existing animations across different characters or skeletons. By implementing a retargeting system in C++, we can provide animators with a powerful tool to streamline their animation workflow.

In this blog post, we explored the key steps involved in implementing a retargeting system, including mapping bone hierarchies, applying transformation matrices, and interpolating and blending animations. By incorporating these techniques into animation tools, we can empower animators to create captivating and dynamic animations with ease.
