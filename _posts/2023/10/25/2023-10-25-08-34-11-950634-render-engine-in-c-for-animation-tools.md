In the world of animation, a render engine plays a crucial role in bringing visuals to life. It is responsible for converting 3D models, textures, and lighting into the final rendered images or frames that we see on screen. A well-designed and efficient render engine is the backbone of any animation software.

In this blog post, we will explore the basics of building a render engine using C++. We will cover the key components and techniques involved in the process.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

A render engine typically follows a rendering pipeline that consists of various stages. These stages can include geometry processing, rasterization, shading, and lighting. Each stage performs specific tasks to transform geometric data into rendered images.

## Rendering Pipeline <a name="rendering-pipeline"></a>

The rendering pipeline is a series of stages that allow us to transform 3D models to 2D images. In a simplified form, the pipeline comprises the following stages:

1. **Geometry Processing:** This stage involves transforming vertices, handling transformations like scaling, rotation, and translation, and performing operations like culling, clipping, and projection.

2. **Rasterization:** The rasterization stage converts the transformed geometry into pixels on the screen. It involves determining which pixels are covered by the geometry and calculating the interpolated values for those pixels.

3. **Shading:** Shading is the process of assigning colors to pixels based on various lighting models, materials, and textures. It takes into account the position of the light source, surface normals, and other parameters to determine the appearance of the surface.

4. **Lighting:** Lighting is responsible for simulating the interaction between light and surfaces. It determines how light sources affect the colors and intensity of the pixels.

## Geometry Processing <a name="geometry-processing"></a>

Geometry processing involves transforming the 3D models by applying various transformations like scaling, rotation, and translation. It also performs operations like culling and clipping to optimize the rendering process. In this stage, the geometry is prepared for rasterization and shading.

## Rasterization <a name="rasterization"></a>

Rasterization is the process of converting the transformed geometry into pixels on the screen. It determines which pixels are covered by the geometry and calculates the interpolated values for those pixels. This stage is essential for determining the visible portions of the objects.

## Shading <a name="shading"></a>

Shading is the stage where the colors and appearance of the pixels are determined based on lighting models, materials, and textures. It takes into account the position of the light source, surface normals, and other parameters to calculate pixel colors. Shading algorithms can range from simple to complex, depending on the desired visual effects.

## Lighting <a name="lighting"></a>

Lighting is responsible for simulating the interaction between light and surfaces. It determines how light sources affect the colors and intensity of the pixels. There are various lighting models and techniques available, such as Phong lighting, global illumination, and physically-based rendering (PBR).

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

Building a render engine from scratch is a complex and challenging task, but it is also a rewarding experience. Understanding the rendering pipeline and the various stages involved is essential for creating high-quality animation tools.

In this blog post, we introduced the basics of a render engine, including the rendering pipeline, geometry processing, rasterization, shading, and lighting. Hopefully, this serves as a starting point for anyone interested in diving deeper into the world of rendering engines.
