Animations play a crucial role in various applications and games. However, handling and storing large animation data can be quite challenging due to their size and complexity. Animation compression algorithms help reduce the storage space required for animation data while preserving the visual quality and smoothness of the animations.

In this article, we will explore some popular animation compression algorithms implemented in C++ that can be used in animation tools.

## Introduction to Animation Compression

Animation compression refers to the process of reducing the amount of data required to represent an animation while maintaining its visual quality. Various compression techniques can be used based on the type of animation data and the requirements of the application.

## Linear Keyframe Compression

One common approach to compressing animation data is linear keyframe compression. In this technique, instead of storing every individual keyframe, only the keyframes at specific intervals are saved. The interpolated values between these keyframes can be calculated during runtime, reducing the storage requirements significantly.

To implement linear keyframe compression, you can use techniques such as linear interpolation or spherical linear interpolation (slerp), depending on the type of animation data. These algorithms help in smoothly transitioning between keyframes while maintaining the desired motion.

## Spline-based Compression

Another popular compression technique is spline-based compression. This approach represents animations using spline curves instead of individual keyframes. The spline curves can be used to interpolate positions, rotations, and other animation properties at runtime, resulting in a more compact representation of the animation data.

You can use spline interpolation algorithms like cubic splines or BÃ©zier curves to interpolate between control points and generate smooth animation paths. Spline-based compression can effectively reduce the number of keyframes required to represent an animation, leading to significant storage savings.

## Differential Compression

Differential compression is a technique that stores the differences or changes between consecutive frames instead of storing their absolute values. By storing only the changes, the overall amount of animation data can be greatly reduced.

In differential compression, the values for each property in a frame are calculated as the difference from the previous frame. This technique is particularly useful for animations with repetitive motion or small variations between frames.
