Animation tools often require the capability to manipulate the timeline in order to create interactive and dynamic animations. Manipulating the timeline allows us to control when and how different elements of the animation are triggered, creating engaging and immersive experiences.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement timeline manipulation using C++. We will cover concepts such as keyframes, interpolation, and playback control. Let's dive in!

## Keyframes

Keyframes are the foundational building blocks of animation timelines. They represent specific points in time where the properties of an animated element are defined. Each keyframe contains the values of these properties at a given point in time.

To implement keyframes in C++, we can define a `Keyframe` class that contains the time at which it occurs and a collection of property values. These properties can be represented by a `std::map` or a custom data structure based on the requirements of your animation tool.

```cpp
class Keyframe {
public:
    float time;
    std::map<std::string, PropertyValue> properties;
};
```

By storing keyframes in a sorted collection, such as a `std::vector` or a custom data structure, we can easily access and manipulate the properties at specific points in time.

## Interpolation

Interpolation is the process of calculating intermediate values between keyframes. It allows for smooth transitions between different states of an animated element. Common interpolation techniques include linear interpolation, bezier curves, and spline interpolation.

To achieve interpolation in C++, we can define a `Timeline` class that holds a collection of keyframes and provides methods for retrieving interpolated values at a given time.

```cpp
class Timeline {
public:
    std::vector<Keyframe> keyframes;

    PropertyValue getInterpolatedValue(const std::string& property, float time) {
        // Find the two keyframes surrounding the desired time
        Keyframe* previousKeyframe = nullptr;
        Keyframe* nextKeyframe = nullptr;

        for (auto& keyframe : keyframes) {
            if (keyframe.time <= time) {
                previousKeyframe = &keyframe;
            } else if (keyframe.time > time) {
                nextKeyframe = &keyframe;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (!previousKeyframe || !nextKeyframe) {
            // Handle the case where time is outside the range of keyframes
            return PropertyValue();
        }

        // Perform interpolation based on the interpolation technique of your choice
        // ...

        return interpolatedValue;
    }
};
```

By implementing the `getInterpolatedValue` method, we can retrieve the interpolated value of a property at any given time. This value can then be used to animate the corresponding element in our animation tool.

## Playback Control

Playback control refers to the ability to control the animation timeline, such as starting, pausing, resuming, or seeking to a specific time. This functionality is essential for creating interactive animations.

To implement playback control in C++, we can extend our `Timeline` class with methods for controlling the animation's playback.

```cpp
enum class PlaybackState {
    Playing,
    Paused,
    Stopped
};

class Timeline {
public:
    std::vector<Keyframe> keyframes;
    PlaybackState state;
    float currentTime;

    void play() {
        state = PlaybackState::Playing;
        // Start animation loop
    }

    void pause() {
        state = PlaybackState::Paused;
        // Pause animation loop
    }

    void stop() {
        state = PlaybackState::Stopped;
        currentTime = 0.0f;
        // Stop animation and reset to initial state
    }

    void seek(float time) {
        currentTime = time;
        // Seek animation to the desired time
    }
};
```

By introducing the `state` variable, we can keep track of the current playback state of the animation. We can then utilize this state to control the animation loop accordingly.

## Conclusion

Implementing timeline manipulation in C++ is crucial for building powerful animation tools. By understanding keyframes, interpolation, and playback control, we can create dynamic and interactive animations with ease.
