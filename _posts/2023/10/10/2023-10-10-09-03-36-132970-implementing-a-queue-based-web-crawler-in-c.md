Web crawling is a common task in web development and data extraction. A web crawler is a program that automatically traverses the web and extracts useful information from web pages. In this blog post, we'll learn how to implement a basic queue-based web crawler in C++.

## Introduction
A queue-based web crawler follows a breadth-first approach to crawl web pages. It starts with a seed URL and retrieves its content. Then, it extracts links from the page and adds them to a queue. The crawler repeats this process for each URL in the queue until either a specified depth is reached or the queue becomes empty.

## Setting up the Project
Before we start implementing the web crawler, let's set up the project by creating a new C++ file and including the necessary libraries. For this implementation, we'll use the standard library along with the `libcurl` library for fetching web page content.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <curl/curl.h>

// Rest of the code goes here
```

## Implementing the Crawler
To implement the web crawler, we'll define a `Crawler` class that encapsulates the crawling logic. This class will have a member variable to hold the URLs to be crawled and a member function to start the crawling process.

```cpp
class Crawler {
public:
    void startCrawling(const std::string& seedUrl, int depth);
    
private:
    std::queue<std::string> urlQueue;
    std::set<std::string> visitedUrls;
    
    void crawlUrl(const std::string& url);
    std::string fetchPageContent(const std::string& url);
    std::vector<std::string> extractLinks(const std::string& content);
};
```

The `startCrawling` function takes a seed URL and a depth parameter. It initializes the URL queue with the seed URL and starts the crawling process. We'll implement the rest of the class functions.

## Crawling Web Pages
The `crawlUrl` function fetches the page content of a given URL, extracts the links from it, and adds them to the URL queue. We'll use the `libcurl` library to fetch the page content.

```cpp
void Crawler::crawlUrl(const std::string& url) {
    std::string pageContent = fetchPageContent(url);
    std::vector<std::string> links = extractLinks(pageContent);
    
    for (const std::string& link : links) {
        if (visitedUrls.count(link) == 0) {
            urlQueue.push(link);
            visitedUrls.insert(link);
        }
    }
}
```

The `fetchPageContent` function uses `libcurl` to fetch the page content by making an HTTP GET request to the URL.

```cpp
std::string Crawler::fetchPageContent(const std::string& url) {
    // Code to fetch page content using libcurl
}
```

The `extractLinks` function parses the page content and extracts links by using a regular expression or a dedicated HTML parser library.

```cpp
std::vector<std::string> Crawler::extractLinks(const std::string& content) {
    // Code to extract links from the page content
}
```

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we learned how to implement a basic queue-based web crawler in C++. We explored the concepts behind web crawling and implemented the crawling logic step by step. This implementation can be extended and customized based on specific requirements. Happy crawling!
