When working with data structures in C++, one commonly used container is the priority queue. A priority queue is similar to a regular queue, but with an added twist. Instead of following a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order like a regular queue, a priority queue maintains a specific order based on the priority assigned to each element.

## How Does a Priority Queue Work?

In a priority queue, elements are stored in a way that ensures the element with the highest priority is always at the front and ready to be accessed. The priority of each element is determined either by a comparison operator or a custom comparator function.

## Using the `std::priority_queue` Class

In C++, the standard library provides the `std::priority_queue` class to implement priority queues. This class is part of the `<queue>` header and allows you to easily create and manage a priority queue.

Here's an example of how to use the `std::priority_queue` class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Creating a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(20);

    // Accessing the top element
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Checking if the priority queue is empty
    if (pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Priority queue is empty!" << std::endl;
    }

    // Get the size of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Size of priority queue: " << pq.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In the example above, we first include the necessary headers `<iostream>` and `<queue>`. Then, we create a priority queue `pq` to store integers.

We insert elements into the priority queue using the `push()` method, and access the top element using `top()`. To remove the top element, we use `pop()`. The `empty()` method checks if the priority queue is empty, and `size()` returns the number of elements in the priority queue.

## Customizing the Priority Queue

By default, the `std::priority_queue` class orders elements in descending order, using the `<` operator. If you need to change the order or use a custom object as an element in the priority queue, you can provide a custom comparator.

Here's an example of using a custom comparator to order strings in ascending order:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <functional> // for std::greater

int main() {
    // Creating a priority queue of strings in ascending order
    std::priority_queue<std::string, std::vector<std::string>, std::greater<std::string>> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push("orange");
    pq.push("apple");
    pq.push("banana");

    // Accessing the top element
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Checking if the priority queue is empty
    if (pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Priority queue is empty!" << std::endl;
    }

    // Get the size of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Size of priority queue: " << pq.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use the `std::greater` comparator to order the strings in ascending order. The `std::greater` functor is provided by the `<functional>` header.

## Conclusion

Priority queues are a powerful data structure that can be useful in various scenarios where elements need to be accessed based on their priority. The `std::priority_queue` class in C++ provides a convenient way to work with priority queues and can be customized based on your specific requirements.
