Queue is an abstract data type that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is commonly used in programming to efficiently manage elements in a sequential manner. However, unlike arrays or lists, queues do not inherently provide a sorted order for the elements.

In some scenarios, sorting the elements in a queue can be beneficial for processing or displaying the data. This article will explain how to sort a queue in C++ using a simple sorting algorithm.

## Algorithm Overview

To sort a queue in C++, we can make use of a temporary queue and a simple sorting algorithm such as Selection Sort or Bubble Sort. Here, we will use the Selection Sort algorithm as it is easy to implement.

The general steps involved in sorting a queue are as follows:

1. Create a temporary empty queue.
2. Find the smallest (or largest) element in the original queue using a traversal.
3. Remove the smallest (or largest) element from the original queue and insert it into the temporary queue.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the original queue becomes empty.
5. Swap the original queue with the temporary queue.
6. The original queue is now sorted.

## Sorting a Queue in C++ Example

Let's consider an example where we have an integer queue that we want to sort in ascending order. Here's the C++ code snippet that demonstrates the sorting process:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

queue<int> sortQueue(queue<int>& q) {
    if (q.empty()) {
        return q; // Return an empty queue if given queue is empty
    }

    int n = q.size();

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        // Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the queue
        int minIndex = i;
        int minValue = q.front();
        queue<int> temp;

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int current = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (current < minValue) {
                minValue = current;
                minIndex = j;
            }

            temp.push(current);
        }

        // Move the minimum element to the back of the queue
        while (!temp.empty()) {
            if (temp.front() != minValue) {
                q.push(temp.front());
            }
            temp.pop();
        }
        q.push(minValue);
    }

    return q; // Return the sorted queue
}

int main() {
    queue<int> myQueue;
    myQueue.push(5);
    myQueue.push(2);
    myQueue.push(9);
    myQueue.push(1);

    cout << "Original Queue: ";

    while (!myQueue.empty()) {
        cout << myQueue.front() << " ";
        myQueue.pop();
    }

    cout << endl;

    myQueue.push(5);
    myQueue.push(2);
    myQueue.push(9);
    myQueue.push(1);

    queue<int> sortedQueue = sortQueue(myQueue);

    cout << "Sorted Queue: ";

    while (!sortedQueue.empty()) {
        cout << sortedQueue.front() << " ";
        sortedQueue.pop();
    }

    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define the `sortQueue` function that takes a reference to a queue as a parameter and returns a sorted queue. It uses the selection sort algorithm to sort the elements in the queue. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `sortQueue` function to sort a queue of integers.

## Conclusion

Sorting a queue can be achieved by implementing a simple sorting algorithm and using a temporary queue. In this article, we discussed how to sort a queue in C++ using the selection sort algorithm. Understanding this concept can help you manage and process data efficiently in your C++ programs.
