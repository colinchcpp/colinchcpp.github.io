The \<iostream> library in C++ provides a convenient way to perform input and output operations. By including this library in your C++ program, you can easily read input from the user and display output on the screen.

## Standard Input with cin

The `cin` object in the \<iostream> library is used to read input from the user. You can use `cin` to read different types of data, such as integers, characters, or strings.

Here's an example of how to use `cin` to read an integer from the user:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int number;
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> number;
    std::cout << "You entered: " << number << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, the user is prompted to enter a number using `std::cout`, and the input is then stored in the `number` variable using `std::cin`. Finally, the entered number is displayed back to the user using `std::cout`.

## Standard Output with cout

The `cout` object in the \<iostream> library is used to display output on the screen. You can use `cout` to display different types of data, such as integers, characters, or strings.

Here's an example of how to use `cout` to display a message on the screen:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, `Hello, World!` is displayed on the screen using `std::cout`. The `<<` operator is used to output the message, and `std::endl` is used to insert a newline character.

## Conclusion

The \<iostream> library in C++ provides a simplified way to perform input and output operations. With the `cin` object, you can easily read input from the user, and with the `cout` object, you can display output on the screen. By including this library in your C++ program, you can streamline the input and output process.
