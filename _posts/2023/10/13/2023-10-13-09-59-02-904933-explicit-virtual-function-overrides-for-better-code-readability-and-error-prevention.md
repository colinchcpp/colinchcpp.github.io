When working with object-oriented programming languages, such as C++, it is common to define a base class with virtual functions that can be overridden in derived classes. This allows for polymorphism and dynamic binding, enabling more flexible and extensible code.

However, there is a potential risk when overriding virtual functions in derived classes, especially in large codebases with complex inheritance hierarchies. The risk lies in unintentional mistakes, such as misspelling the function name or providing incorrect parameters, which can lead to subtle bugs that are hard to detect.

To address this issue and improve code readability and error prevention, it is highly recommended to use explicit function override syntax. This feature was introduced in C++11 and allows you to explicitly mark a function in a derived class as intended to override a virtual function from the base class.

The syntax for explicit function override is as follows:

```cpp
return_type DerivedClass::function_name(parameters) override {
    // function implementation
}
```

By using the `override` keyword, you are indicating to the compiler that the intention is to override a base class function. This makes it clear to anyone reading the code that the function is meant to override a virtual function and not introduce a new one with a similar name.

Explicit virtual function overrides offer several benefits:

## 1. Improved Code Readability
When reviewing or navigating through the code, it becomes immediately apparent that a function is intended to override a base class function. This reduces confusion and enhances the overall readability of the codebase.

## 2. Enhanced Error Prevention
The `override` keyword enables the compiler to perform additional checks at compile-time, ensuring that the function you have declared as an override in the derived class actually matches the base class function signature. If there are any discrepancies, the compiler will generate an error, highlighting the issue before it causes runtime bugs.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of explicit virtual function overrides:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() const {
        // implementation for the base class
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const override {
        // implementation specific to Circle class
    }
};

class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() {
        // incorrect implementation with missing const qualifier
    }
};
```

In this example, the `Shape` base class has a virtual function `draw()` that is intended to be overridden by derived classes. The `Circle` class correctly overrides the function using the `override` keyword. On the other hand, the `Square` class mistakenly misses the `const` qualifier. By using explicit overrides, the compiler will generate an error for the incorrect implementation in the `Square` class, catching the mistake early on.

By explicitly marking virtual function overrides, you can avoid potential bugs caused by unintentional mistakes in function signatures. It promotes code maintainability and reduces the likelihood of introducing subtle errors. Therefore, it is good practice to use explicit virtual function overrides in your object-oriented code.
