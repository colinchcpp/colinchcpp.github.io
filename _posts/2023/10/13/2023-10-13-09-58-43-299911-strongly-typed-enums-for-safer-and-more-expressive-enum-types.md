Enums are a powerful feature in many programming languages that allow us to define a set of named values. They are often used to represent a group of related constants or options. However, traditional enums can sometimes lead to issues like naming clashes and poor type safety. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of strongly-typed enums and how they can enhance safety and expressiveness in your code.

## Understanding traditional enums

Before we dive into strongly-typed enums, let's quickly recap traditional enums. In languages like C or Java, enums are created with a list of values and are typically represented as integers. For example, consider a traditional enum representing the days of the week:

```java
enum Day {
  MONDAY,
  TUESDAY,
  WEDNESDAY,
  THURSDAY,
  FRIDAY,
  SATURDAY,
  SUNDAY
}
```

While this approach is simple and works in many cases, traditional enums suffer from some limitations. The main issue is that they are not strongly typed, meaning that any integer can be assigned to them, even if they are not part of the defined set of values. This can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior in your code.

## Introducing strongly-typed enums

Strongly-typed enums, also known as enum classes, are a more advanced version of enums that provide type safety and expressiveness. Unlike traditional enums, enum classes allow developers to define a specific set of values that the enum can take. Let's take a look at how an enum class can be defined in a language like Kotlin:

```kotlin
enum class Day {
  MONDAY,
  TUESDAY,
  WEDNESDAY,
  THURSDAY,
  FRIDAY,
  SATURDAY,
  SUNDAY
}
```

By using an enum class, we ensure that variables of type `Day` can only be assigned to one of the defined values, making our code more robust and error-free. This eliminates the possibility of accidental assignments of invalid values.

## Benefits of strongly-typed enums

### Enhanced type safety

Strongly-typed enums provide enhanced type safety by enforcing that variables can only take values from the defined set. This prevents unexpected behavior and reduces the chances of runtime errors. The compiler can catch any invalid assignments at compile-time, saving developers from potential bugs and reducing debugging efforts.

### Improved expressiveness

By using strongly-typed enums, our code becomes more expressive and self-documenting. The enum values serve as descriptive labels that clearly represent the intended meaning. This makes the code more readable and maintainable, as the purpose of each enum value becomes explicit.

### Avoiding naming clashes

Since enum classes define their own namespace, they allow us to avoid naming clashes that can occur with traditional enums. If we have two traditional enums with the same value name, it would result in a conflict. However, with strongly-typed enums, each enum value is uniquely identified within its enum class, eliminating any naming conflicts.

## Conclusion

Strongly-typed enums offer a safer and more expressive approach to working with enum types. By enforcing type safety and eliminating naming clashes, they help in building more reliable and maintainable code. When faced with the choice, consider using enum classes instead of traditional enums to enhance the safety and readability of your codebase.
