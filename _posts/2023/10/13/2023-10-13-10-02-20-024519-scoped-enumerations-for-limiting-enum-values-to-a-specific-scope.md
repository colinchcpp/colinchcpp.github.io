In many programming languages, enumerations (enums) are used to define a set of named values. Enums allow us to represent a collection of related values in a structured and type-safe manner. However, in some cases, we need to limit the usage of enum values to a specific scope, such as a class or a namespace. Scoped enumerations come to the rescue in such scenarios.

Scoped enumerations, also known as enum classes or enum structs, were introduced as a language feature in several modern programming languages like C++11, Rust, and Swift. They are an enhanced version of traditional enums with a few key differences.

## Traditional Enums vs Scoped Enums

Traditional enums allow their values to be used globally and can lead to confusion and naming clashes when used across different scopes. For example, let's consider a traditional enum called `Color`:

```cpp
enum Color {
    RED,
    GREEN,
    BLUE
};
```

In this case, the `Color` enum values can be accessed globally, potentially causing conflicts if another enum with the same names is defined elsewhere.

Scoped enums, on the other hand, introduce scoping to enum values, making them confined to a specific scope. Here's how we can define a scoped enum using C++11:

```cpp
enum class Color {
    RED,
    GREEN,
    BLUE
};
```

Here, the keyword `class` makes the `Color` enum scoped, and we can only access its values using the enum type name (`Color::RED`, `Color::GREEN`, `Color::BLUE`). This ensures that enum values are encapsulated and don't clash with other names in different scopes.

## Benefits of Scoped Enumerations

Scoped enumerations provide several benefits when compared to traditional enums:

1. **Encapsulation**: Scoped enums encapsulate their values within a specific scope, preventing naming conflicts and improving code organization.

2. **Type Safety**: Scoped enums are strongly typed, meaning that enum values can't be implicitly converted to other types. This prevents accidental misuse of enum values and improves program correctness.

3. **Explicit Scoping**: Scoped enums explicitly state their scope, making the code more self-explanatory and reducing the likelihood of errors caused by name clashes.

## Conclusion

Scoped enums are a valuable addition to programming languages, providing a way to limit enum values to specific scopes. They enhance code organization, prevent naming conflicts, and improve type safety. If your programming language supports scoped enumerations, it is worth considering using them to enforce better encapsulation and reduce potential bugs.
