With the introduction of User-defined Literal (UDL) in C++, you can now define custom suffixes for numeric literals. This allows you to create your own literal types and make the code more expressive and readable.

## What are user-defined literals?

User-defined literals (UDL) are a feature in C++ that allows you to define custom suffixes for numeric literals. These suffixes can be used to create your own literal types and enhance the readability and expressiveness of your code.

## Syntax

The syntax for defining user-defined suffixes for numeric literals is as follows:

```cpp
return_type operator "" suffix_name (parameter(s))
```

Here, `return_type` represents the type that the suffix will return, and `suffix_name` represents the custom suffix you want to define. You can also define parameters within the parentheses if necessary.

## Example

Let's say we want to define a custom suffix `_km` for representing distances in kilometers. We can define it as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

constexpr long double operator"" _km(long double km) {
    return km * 1000;
}

int main() {
    long double distance = 10.5_km;
    std::cout << "Distance: " << distance << " meters\n";

    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, the `constexpr` function `operator"" _km` is defined to convert the provided value in kilometers to meters. The suffix `_km` is appended to the distance value `10.5`, indicating that it should be interpreted as 10.5 kilometers. The `main` function then uses the converted distance in meters.

## Benefits of user-defined literals

User-defined literals offer several benefits:

1. **Readability**: By defining custom suffixes, you can make your code more expressive and readable. It allows you to write code closer to the problem domain, making it easier to understand.
2. **Type safety**: User-defined literals allow you to enforce type safety by explicitly defining the return type of the suffix. This helps prevent accidental misuse of the literals.
3. **Consistency**: By using custom suffixes, you can maintain consistency throughout your codebase. It becomes easier to handle units and conversions consistently without relying on comments or external documentation.

## Conclusion

User-defined suffixes for defining custom numeric literals in C++ provide a way to enhance the readability and expressiveness of your code. By defining custom suffixes, you can create your own literal types and make the code more domain-specific. Use this feature to improve the overall code quality, readability, and maintainability of your C++ programs.
