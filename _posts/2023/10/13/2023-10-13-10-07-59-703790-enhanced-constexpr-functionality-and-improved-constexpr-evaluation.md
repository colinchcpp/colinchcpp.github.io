## Introduction
The `constexpr` keyword was introduced in C++11 to specify that a function, object, or expression can be evaluated at compile-time. This allows for more efficient and optimized code execution. With subsequent versions of C++, the `constexpr` functionality has been enhanced to support a wider range of use cases and improve performance.

## What is `constexpr`
In C++, the `constexpr` keyword declares that an object or a function can be evaluated at compile-time, ensuring that its value is computed during compilation rather than at run-time. This allows for better performance and the ability to use the result in other compile-time expressions.

## Enhancements to `constexpr`
### Non-type template parameters
With C++14, `constexpr` can be used to define non-type template parameters, enabling the usage of compile-time constants as template arguments. This allows for more flexibility when working with templates and enables better optimization opportunities.

### String literals
Starting from C++17, `constexpr` can be used with string literals, allowing for compile-time string manipulation and easier integration with other `constexpr` expressions. This greatly enhances the usability of `constexpr` in string-related operations.

### Loops and branching
C++20 introduced the ability to use `constexpr` in loops and branching constructs, such as `if` statements and `switch` cases. This enables compile-time evaluation of loops and conditional statements, further extending the capabilities of `constexpr`.

## Improved `constexpr` evaluation
In addition to the enhanced functionality, the evaluation of `constexpr` expressions has also been improved, leading to better performance and more powerful compile-time computations.

### Constant propagation
The compiler can now perform constant propagation more efficiently for `constexpr` expressions. This means that if the inputs to a `constexpr` expression are known at compile-time, the compiler can directly compute the result without any runtime overhead.

### Compile-time computation
Thanks to the improvements in `constexpr` evaluation, more complex computations can now be done at compile-time. This includes complex mathematical calculations, string manipulations, and even iteration over collections, all without any runtime cost.

## Conclusion
The enhanced `constexpr` functionality in modern C++ has brought significant improvements to compile-time evaluation and code optimization. With support for non-type template parameters, string literals, and loops, the usability of `constexpr` has expanded dramatically. Combined with improved `constexpr` evaluation, developers can achieve more efficient and powerful compile-time computations, leading to better performance in their C++ programs.
